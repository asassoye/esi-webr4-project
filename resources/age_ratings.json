    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of would-be vigilantes and criminals that fight for control over a stylized Gotham City. Players use assault rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and assorted gadgets (e.g., ninja smoke bombs, grappling guns) to attack enemies in team-based combat. These over-the-top battles are often accompanied by gunfire, large explosions, and cries of pain; brief blood-splatter effects can occur as enemies are shot or injured. Characters can also be temporarily impaled with arrows, or frozen and shattered to pieces as a result of an ice gun. Some female characters are depicted in form-fitting outfits and lingerie that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage; a “sensual” voice option is also available in the customization menu (e.g., “I hope you bats like it rough.”). The game includes character profile phrases such as “Cuts the cheese,”“Holding down the fart,” and “I peed on it. It's mine”; one comical sequence depicts a baby vomiting onto a refrigerator. The dialogue includes language censored by audible bleeps (e.g., “Listen to me, you mother-[bleep] clowns!” and “Yep! [bleep] for brains!”); one cutscene depicts a character sticking up his middle finger (partially obscured). Unedited words such as “a*s” and \"damn\" can also be heard in dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a strategy game in which players must save present-day Earth from an alien invasion. As players manage resources, research weapon technology, and monitor alien presence, they can dispatch squads of soldiers to attack human- and insect-like creatures in turn-based combat. From a 3/4-top-down perspective, players use assault rifles, grenades, and other military-grade weapons to kill nearby enemies. Battles are accompanied by intermittent cutscenes that depict close-up (e.g., over-the-shoulder) instances of violence: soldiers getting impaled or beaten to death by alien creatures; realistic explosions that result in larger blood sprays. If an alien “implants” an egg into a dead human, the character will eventually explode amid additional gibbing effects. Some scenes depict dead or dying soldiers whose bodies are burned or mutilated. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players use machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, and grenades to kill enemy soldiers in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and slow-motion effects (during headshots); injured characters emit blood splashes when hit, and continue to incur damage when killed. Players can also “execute” or incapacitate enemies at close range (e.g., punching soldiers in the face or snapping their necks). Some weapons cause injuries such as dismembered limbs or scattered body parts; a handful of sequences depict severely burned or mutilated corpses. During the course of the game, players have the ability to shoot unarmed civilians or open fire on angry mobs. Cutscenes also include intense instances of violence: bloodied characters getting interrogated and/or executed; soldiers getting shot in the head at point-blank range. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players control Agent 47, a rogue assassin attempting to rescue a girl from various factions. From first- and third-person perspectives, players use machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, and explosives to complete mission objectives and kill human adversaries. Players can also employ stealth tactics (e.g., strangling or slicing characters' throats from behind) to eliminate adversaries at close range. Violent encounters are accompanied by realistic gunfire/explosions, large blood-splatter/pooling effects, and slow-motion attacks. Non-adversary characters can be injured or killed at will (e.g., throwing a bomb into a crowd of civilians), though this may negatively affect players' score; in one level, players discover the dead bodies of nun characters, with blood splatter on their clothing and in the hallways (the actual killings are not depicted). Other intense sequences include the use of a wood chipper to dispose of dead bodies (streams of bloody gibs are depicted), and an interrogation scene depicting a security guard beaten up by villains. The game includes suggestive/sexual material: One level takes place inside a strip club, which depicts women dancing on poles or performing lap dances in front of male clients; some strippers wear small pasties over their nipples. Other sexual material includes a female character briefly reaching for a man's groin, and a woman stripping down to lingerie in front of Agent 47 (e.g., “I love a hard man . . .”). During some missions, characters can be observed snorting cocaine off a table or smoking from a bong near marijuana plants. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,”“p*ssy,” and “c*cksucker” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players use pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, swords, and axes to kill human enemies and demonic creatures; the frenetic battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood that stain the surrounding environment. Players can also use snake-like Demon Arms (attached to Jackie's body) to impale enemies, collect human hearts, and perform “execution” moves. These executions depict several “over-the-top” instances of violence: tearing enemies' limbs/heads from bodies; slicing characters in half; removing characters' spines. In some sequences, players have the ability to attack and kill bystanders or unarmed adversaries. During the course of the game, players can enter a brothel and walk through its halls. A few instances of sexual activity can be observed in the brothel: a woman performing fellatio on a man (e.g., camera depicts the woman's head moving up and down); a man pushing up against a woman's posterior as she is bent over—sexual moaning and slapping sounds can be heard, though nudity and close-up depictions of these sex acts are never shown. The dialogue occasionally references drugs (e.g., “[H]e was too busy snortin' coke off a hooker's a*s.”) and includes the words “f**k,”“sh*t,”“c*nt,” and “a*shole.”"

As the noir–style storyline unfolds, players use machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and explosives to kill human adversaries (e.g., armed thugs, gang members, paramilitary units) in frenetic combat. Slow-motion effects (i.e., “bullet time”) can be utilized for improved targeting precision, and killing certain enemies triggers a zoomed-in “bullet cam” (close-ups of entry/exit wounds/headshots). Frantic screaming and realistic gunfire occur throughout, and characters emit large blood-splatter effects when hit; some explosions (in gameplay and cutscenes) result in dismembered limbs or bloodstained surroundings. Non-adversaries—if unrelated to the storyline—can be killed without consequence, and dead bodies may incur additional damage. A variety of cutscenes (some interactive) include more intense acts of violence: a hostage getting shot at point-blank range; a man getting doused with gasoline and set on fire; an injured, bleeding enemy crying out during an interrogation. During the course of the game, Max visits a strip club that depicts topless pole dancers. As he enters the club, fleeting sexual activity can be observed in the background: a partially nude prostitute sitting on top of a man; a character thrusting against a woman, whose body is partially obscured by two onlookers. The game sometimes references or portrays illegal substances (e.g., a “drug den” with bags of white powder scattered across a counter); in a couple of sequences, characters are depicted snorting cocaine. Alcoholism is a significant component of Max's character, and several cutscenes portray him drinking heavily and/or stumbling amid blurred screen effects. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,”“c*cksucker,”“c*nt,”“sp*c,” and “n*gga” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players can also employ stealth tactics (e.g., poisoning a character's food/drink; slitting their throats from behind; strangling them with fiber wire) to eliminate adversaries at close range. Violent encounters are accompanied by realistic gunfire/explosions, large blood-splatter effects, and characters pleading for their lives; dead bodies incur additional damage when shot. Non-adversaries can be injured/killed at will (this may negatively affect players' score), and some sequences allow players to kill police officers. Some sequences reference sexuality/prostitution (e.g., “This little bad boy can transform even the most ardent Buddhist monk into a sex-craving lunatic,”“Rumor has it she killed a John trying to rape her,”“The press published photographs of one of his orgies . . .”). Some party scenes feature women in skimpy lingerie (e.g., string bikinis, thin strips of cloth), and other missions portray women performing lap dances while men caress their chest and buttocks. In a couple of sequences, characters can be observed snorting cocaine off nearby tables. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a puzzle adventure game in which players assume the role of Vincent, a man with relationship issues that are manifested in his dreams. The game transitions between animated cutscenes and puzzle stages (i.e., nightmares); in the nightmare world, players must help Vincent ascend crumbling towers by pushing, pulling, and climbing blocks to reach an exit. If players make the wrong move, they can be killed by spike traps and giant boss creatures (e.g., a demon bride, a chainsaw-wielding baby); death scenes are accompanied by exaggerated splashes of blood as Vincent is stabbed, crushed, shot, or bitten. During one cutscene, a character is stabbed in the stomach with a knife; a large pool of blood quickly forms under her body. In order to move faster in the puzzles stages, players can order Vincent alcoholic beverages (e.g., mixed cocktails, beer, sake, whiskey); after three drinks, he begins to stumble around when moving. These sequences are accompanied by voice-over narration: “It's said that chugging alcohol isn't good for you, but sometimes it's necessary” and “[T]ake a big swig of cognac!” Throughout the game, sex and sexuality are frequently referenced, sometimes while two characters are in bed together (e.g., “I finally became a man! Got rid of my V-card, BOOM,”“If the one you loved confessed to a sexual habit that you found absolutely unacceptable, what would you do?” and “After all you've done to my body . . . Night after night . . .”). One bedroom sequence pans across a man's legs, then to his curling toes; another scene briefly depicts a woman caressing her body while making suggestive comments (e.g., “I've got such a hunger for these feelings . . . I know you have some hungers as well, don't you?” ). The game also depicts the central character surrounded by topless female demons—though shadow effects obscure most details. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players can modify and customize their creatures by adapting various traits such as wings, horns, or feet. Biological traits are gained through interactions and battles --represented by turn-based combat -- with other rival species. Combat can include raiding and attacking non-threatening creatures/tribes with spears, launching nuclear missiles on rival cities, or engaging in laser fire with spaceships and planets. Creatures occasionally emit colored puffs/plumes of blood when defeated or consumed. Certain species occasionally throw-up food."

Players mostly use swords and magic to battle a series of formerly-human creatures in hand-to-hand combat. Various gauntlet and acrobatic maneuvers can be combined to form strings of different attacks as players get knocked and thrown around – but never die – during battle. Story elements are told through cutscenes that contain mild profanity (e.g., 'a*s'), references to alcohol products such as wine, and mildly suggestive dialogue (e.g., 'I'll go first, but, hey, no staring at my a*s. I've felt you looking' and 'Nice carving I prefer a nice nymph or a succubus myself…')."

Players explore various caves, islands, and pirate ships while interacting with characters and solving puzzles. The game is presented in an irreverent and whimsical manner, which is reflected in the the dialogue; suggestive comments that contribute to the E-10+ rating are as follows: 'I like to get in on Manatee make-out sessions and ride merfolk around!'; 'You and Winslow were pretty hot and heavy, huh?'; and 'Hey, is it weird that I thought you were a little sexy when you were all poxed up?' Some scenes contain mild depictions of characters getting hit by darts, engaging in sword fights, or getting knocked down aboard ships. A scene with more impact depicts a ghost pirate getting stabbed multiple times—though since he is a ghost, there is no apparent injury. During the course of the game, players can obtain grog from a vending machine; there is also a sequence in which a character gets hauled off to the 'drunk tank' for his unruly tavern behavior. The expletive 'hell' can be heard in the dialogue (e.g., 'Hell, I'll take it anyway.')."

Players compete in a series of combative rounds in order to advance to different matches throughout the game. Players use swords, guns, chains, spikes, and supernatural attacks (e.g., fire, ice, lightning) to defeat a cast of human-like characters. After an opponent is defeated at the end of a match, players have the option to perform finishing moves called 'Fatalities.' Many of these finishing moves depict over-the-top instances of violence: impalement, bone-crushing body snaps, execution-style gunshots to the head; large blood-splatter effects occur during these sequences, staining characters' bodies and the ground. Several of these exaggerated finishing moves depict characters getting dismembered, ripped or sliced in half, stabbed, set on fire, or set to explode. During the course of the game, female characters sometimes wear revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; one female fighter is depicted partially nude, covered by a costume of thin cloth strips. Language such as 'f**k' occasionally appears in the dialogue."

Hand-to-hand combat is a major component of gameplay: players can perform “environmental kills” such as throwing enemies into an ice chipper, pushing their heads into a table saw, impaling them on elevated meat hooks—these sequences are accompanied by slow-motion effects, exaggerated blood splatter, and scattered body parts. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence (e.g., unarmed characters getting shot at point-blank range; a restrained character being tortured with a razor and power drill). The game contains sexual material, which can be heard in the dialogue (e.g., “Hey, tell your sister to give me a call, huh? I wouldn't mind giving her a mouthful,”“Tell Ming to stick with girls over 14 this time,” The triads use those places as whorehouses”). In one sequence, a woman is briefly shown reaching for a man's crotch (both characters are fully clothed); in another, players can use in-game credits to make “massage parlor” purchases (the screen fades to black). Drug use is referenced several times, and one cutscene depicts a man snorting an illicit substance. Words such as “f**k,”“c*nt,” and “sh*t” can be heard in dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game in which players perform quests while exploring the fantastical world of Tyria. Players interact with numerous creatures and characters, perform various tasks, and engage in melee-style combat. Players use swords, firearms, explosives, and magic attacks to battle soldiers and enemy creatures (e.g., minotaurs, giant insects, golems). Skirmishes depict enemies getting shot by arrows, slashed by swords, lit on fire, or struck down by lightning bolts; some underwater attacks result in blood-cloud effects, and stylized blood effects are sometimes depicted in cutscenes. Some sequence depict alcohol use: players can earn achievements by consuming alcoholic drinks—the screen appears blurry to denote drunkenness; in a “drinking competition” mini-game, characters drink ale from mugs—the sequence ends when a challenger's health reaches zero. The words “a*s” and “bastard” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of military operatives tasked with thwarting the plans of a terrorist leader. Players complete mission objectives and engage in battles that take place in modern-day locations across the globe (e.g., United States, Great Britain, Germany). Players use pistols, rifles, machine guns, and explosives to injure/kill enemies; the frenetic conflicts are highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood from injured characters. Blood-splatter effects appear often in the surrounding environment, in addition to dead bodies lying in pools of blood. Some sequences depict more intense acts of violence, such as a defenseless prisoner getting lit on fire; a man losing his arm from a sniper shot (with blood spurting from the wound); and a family dying (off-screen) in an explosion. In some instances, scattered packages of drugs appear in the environment (e.g., packets of narcotics that explode in white puffs when shot); in multiplayer mode, players can also unlock an emblem that resembles a cannabis leaf. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the roles of members of an elite squadron on the trail of a Russian ultranationalist. Players defend the U.S. from Russian armed forces, engage in skirmishes and combat missions, and track the ultranationalist in an attempt to discover his true motivations and co-conspirators. Players use machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, and missiles to kill enemy soldiers throughout the battlefields. Realistic gunfire, explosions, and cries of pain are heard during the frequent and fast-paced combat. The most intense depiction of violence occurs during a 'No Russian' mission where players take on the role of an undercover Ranger: Several civilians are gunned down at an airport as players are given a choice to participate in the killings (e.g., players can shoot a wounded civilian that is crawling on the ground), or walk by and observe without opening fire. In either case, civilians scream and emit pools of blood as they are shot to death. Within the multiplayer portion of the game, players can unlock 'emblems' to be used on their player name cards. Some of these emblems contain images that reference drugs (e.g., a cannabis leaf; a name card with a depiction of a joint). Dialogue in the game contains profanity in both English (e.g., 'sh*t') and Russian (e.g., 'f**k' and 'motherf**ker')."

Players roam Wild West environments and perform various missions for criminal figures and law enforcement: destroying bridges, helping individuals in distress, delivering packages of drugs (e.g., opium), capturing outlaws, and eliminating rival figures. Players use shotguns, pistols, and rifles to kill enemies in realistic gun battles. Players can engage in melee-style hand-to-hand combat and trigger slow-motion effects by shooting enemies at close-range or by targeted shooting (i.e., aiming for body parts). Blood often spurts out of characters when shot; head shots and knife attacks result in much larger sprays. In one sequence, a bloodied and mutilated corpse can be seen hanging from the rafters of a barn. Players have the ability to shoot pedestrians in the game; however, a 'Wanted Level'-penalty system discourages these acts by triggering a law enforcement response. The game contains a scene in which two characters have sex on a table; there is a brief instance of female nudity. One sequence depicts a man injecting himself with a syringe filled with cocaine. Language such as 'f**k,' 'c*nt,' and 'sh*t' can be heard in the dialogue."

Players punch, kick, and use a variety of weapons (e.g., knives, swords, crowbars, machine guns, laser blasts) to drain opponents' health meters in melee-style combat. Matches are highlighted by impact sounds, splashes of blood, and colorful light effects as fighters are hurled across the screen or to the ground. As players engage in fantasy combat, they can trigger super attacks and transitional attacks that propel opponents from different levels of fighting arenas. Some up-close attacks depict characters getting smashed to the ground, slashed with swords, or propelled into the air by explosives; one partially obscured scene depicts a villain setting a superhero on fire. Additional acts of violence and/or blood include a character directing laser beams into a superhero's head (partially obscured); a man getting strangled; a character holding a blood-spotted knife over a villain's body.

Players also can shoot at roaming pedestrians (though there is no reward for this action), and in one mission, players shoot at police and civilians to create chaos in a rival gang's territory. One scene prompts players to run over a certain number of pedestrians within a given time; another sequence allows players to dispatch enemies by putting grenades in their mouths.

Players use a wand to fire fantastical blasts at ghostly figures, giant snakes and spiders, and other wizards. Characters screech or cry out in pain when hit, and often break apart into smaller Lego pieces when defeated. In some sequences, players engage in one-on-one wand duels with other characters; one duel ends with a character dramatically dissolving into the air. A few scenes include instances of slapstick humor: a skeleton creature burping; a character floating from a geyser in a toilet; a wizard covering up after his pants are zapped away."

Some of the female characters wear revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage, including a character that frequently appears on menu screens. The dialogue contains repeated references to grog, beer, wine, liqueur, and rum. The words 'a*s,' 'hell,' and 'damn' also appears in dialogue."

As players explore open-world environments, they can perform various quests and complete tasks. Characters use swords, arrows, axes, and magic attacks (e.g., lightning, fire attacks) to kill human-like and fantastical enemies (e.g., orcs, demons, giant insects). Players engage in melee-style combat, hacking and slashing at various enemies; battles are highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and blood splashes. Some sequences depict large amounts of blood streaming up-close as vampires attack/feed on characters. In some quests players have the ability to mount creatures' severed heads onto pikes; some environments depict corpse piles or skeletons hanging from torture devices. Text descriptions or dialogue sometimes contain references to sexual material and/or innuendo (e.g., “She...raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her”; “In his mind, she would be the sheath to every knight's blade”; “No sweetmeat for you”; But it is huge! It could take me all night!”). During the course of the game, alcohol (i.e., wine, mead, ale) can be purchased and consumed by the central character; one sequence prompts players to engage in a drinking contest, resulting in the central character's blurred vision/slurred speech."

The game allows players to sprint at high speeds and glide around an 'open-world' environment to battle giant mutants, military personnel, and infected zombie-like citizens. Players can shape-shift their bodies into weapons (e.g., blades, spikes, and a mace) to slice, bludgeon, impale, eviscerate, and dismember enemies and sometimes non-combatants (e.g., pedestrians, police officers). Blood splatter gushes out of injured victims, staining the ground and walls; body parts and dead bodies sometimes litter the environment as well. During the frenetic combat, players can choose to 'consume' victims in order to take their memories or adapt their appearance and abilities. Some abilities allow players to summon air strikes, pilot a helicopter, or drive a tank that can run over civilians. The game's cutscenes contain real-world photos with digital manipulations of the following: open surgical wounds; a seagull pecking at a corpse; and various human fetuses in jars. These images are highly stylized, sometimes black-and-white, and are usually presented in quick flashes. Strong profanity (e.g., 'f*ck' and 'sh*t') can be heard in the dialogue."

Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large explosions. Unarmed civilians can also be killed without consequence, or “consumed” for a minimal health boost. Some of the more intense attacks result in characters getting crushed, impaled, or sliced in half amid blood splatter and body parts—slow-motion effects and zoomed-in camera angles highlight the over-the-top violence. As the game progresses, some scenes reference sexual material: “One thing you don't really gotta be nervous about: no sex diseases no more,” “No need to touch me. Unless it's on my d*ck,” and “I thought she was having an orgasm . . .” A few sequences also mention drugs (e.g., “Carson is . . . not a nutjob crackhead like most of the Gentek doctors.”), and one fleeting montage depicts a razor blade cutting up a line of cocaine. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “c*nt” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a third-person shooter in which players assume the role of Isaac Clarke, an engineer battling a mysterious alien threat. Players use futuristic weapons (e.g., guns that fire explosives, spikes, incendiary shots) to kill various alien creatures and human enemies. The frenetic combat is accompanied by realistic gunfire and screams of pain. Players can also employ melee kills at close range: hand-to-hand combat, stomping down on enemies, using the butt of a weapon to eliminate adversaries. Blood-splatter effects occur when characters incur damage, and some environments depict blood-splattered floors and mutilated bodies; enemies can be seen impaled, decapitated, and dismembered during the game. The words \"f**k,\"\"sh*t,\" and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Delsin Rowe, a young graffiti artist who gains super human abilities. From a third-person perspective, players explore the city of Seattle and use a chain and elemental-based powers (e.g., cinder blasts, smoke dash, neon shots) to defeat various humans and super-powered enemies. Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and spurts of blood. Players have the ability to attack random civilians, though the activity is not encouraged. During some action-cutscene sequences, players can choose to spare or kill a character (choking a man with a chain). The game also contains sexual material: a red light district; dialogue about foreplay or other suggestive content (“[T]he guy hasn't been laid in seven years,” “Go. Live. Love...just not professionally,” and “Me give you money, that's not how it works honey.”). Drugs are also referenced in dialogue (e.g., “The drugs, the drugs were heaven” and “Better dead than a pothead”). In one comic-book panel, two characters are shown unconscious beside drug paraphernalia. The words “sh*t,” “a*shole,” and “d*ck” can be heard in dialogue."

Using a top-down view, players must cooperatively solve environmental puzzles to avoid traps as they traverse ancient temples and jungle ruins. Players use spears, machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, and remote bombs to defeat a villain's demonic forces. Shooting enemy creatures (e.g., giant spiders, stone creatures, giant lizards, dinosaurs) sometimes results in splashes of colored blood that briefly stain the ground. Realistic gunfire, explosions, and cries of pain are heard throughout the frenetic combat. "

    "synopsis": "This is a fighting game in which players control one of several 13th century characters from the City of Katugsuchi in one-on-one fight matches. Players punch, kick, and use special attacks against opponents until the other character's health meter is depleted. Each character has individualized special attacks, including sword swipes, gunfire, magic, and electrocution. Characters often react to injury by staggering back with a moan, groan, or strained breath. During fight sequences, some female characters' breasts jiggle, while other characters make sexually suggestive remarks (e.g., \"You're as bouncy as always, booby lady.\"). Suggestive moaning and slurping sounds can be heard briefly during one cutscene. A \"Gallery Mode\" includes still images of female characters—in provocative poses—wearing outfits that expose deep cleavage or barely cover their breasts. There are some silhouetted images of a character getting stabbed by a sword as black blood shoots from his body. The game also contains some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t,\"\"b*tch,\" and \"a*s\") in the dialogue."

Players use futuristic machine guns, shotguns, magnum revolvers, assault rifles, and chain guns to perform over-the-top kills that dismember and decapitate foes. Injured enemies emit large sprays of blood that stain the ground and surrounding walls. Specialty kills (i.e., Skillshots) represent the most intense instances of violence: enemies can be dismembered with explosives; impaled on spikes; and drilled into walls, resulting in body parts breaking into pieces. During the course of the game, players can consume alcohol and kill enemies in order to receive an Intoxicated Skillshot; the screen turns blurry during these sequences. The dialogue contains numerous jokes and comments that reference sexual acts, venereal diseases, and having sex with one's mother (e.g., 'Guess I know where the ol' gal got that limp.'). The names of some Skillshots are infused with sexual innuendo (e.g., Gag Reflex, Rear Entry, Drilldo, Mile High Club); one Skillshot (i.e., Fire in the Hole) allows players to shoot at enemies' exposed buttocks. Language such as 'f**k,' 'sh*t,' 'p*ssy,' and 'c*ck' can be heard in dialogue."

Sumo wrestlers, children, animals, and police officers can join the ride, though they sometimes cry out and wriggle around as they get stuck to the giant ball.

Players can explore the Tokyo streets, follow various storylines, and engage in barehanded street fights against other thugs and gangsters. Players punch, kick, grapple, and use katana blades and objects (tables, chairs, signs, etc.) to defeat human enemies. Cutscenes also depict violent acts, including a character getting stabbed in the face with a knife. Brief splashes of blood appear when characters are hit during hand-to-hand combat or wounded by gunfire. During the course of the game, players can visit a gentleman's club and a massage parlor: women in a revealing outfits are depicted dancing provocatively on poles; male/female masseuses sometimes pose suggestively and make comments such as \"I might totally fall for you\" and \"You're such as perv.\" The dialogue also contains various sexual references (e.g., \"Drama Queen's a tranny bar, sweet cheeks\" and \"The manager here is deeelicious . . . totally hetero.

Players can explore ancient ruins in international locales while traversing 3D landscapes embedded with puzzles and traps. Along the way, players will encounter mercenaries/soldiers who will attack with realistic machine guns. Players can brawl with these mercenaries/soldiers, shoot back at them with pistols and rifles, or sneak up on the enemies to perform \"stealth kills\" (e.g., neck-snapping, choke-holds). During gunfights, brief splashes of blood are emitted from characters; more shots—and thus, more blood—are required to kill a growling ice beast. The action sequences are interspersed with cutscenes that are dramatic, but just as often, humorous in tone; a handful of them contain sexual/suggestive innuendo: \"Oh! Is that an ancient Tibetan ritual dagger in your pocket . . . Oh! Maybe I'm just happy to see you\" and \"Well, so much for foreplay . . .\" In one scene, a woman (fully clothed) straddles on top of the central character, places his hands on her hips (he drums his fingers), then kisses him as the camera pans away (to a painting above the bed). In the heat of battle  and  conversation, the words  sh*t ,  b*tch , and  a*s  are sometimes exclaimed."

Players assume the role of Lee Everett as he leads a group of survivors through Georgia during a zombie outbreak. As players progress through the story, they are presented with dialogue and action choices. These selections can sometimes lead to the death of characters and sequences that depict intense violence: a woman shooting herself in the head; a man's leg getting amputated with an ax; a man cutting off his own arm; zombies attacking, disemboweling victims. In some sequences, players use realistic firearms or other objects (e.g., hammer and pitchfork) to kill zombies and other human survivors. These sequences are sometimes accompanied by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood. Blood-splatter effects also appear in the surrounding environment and around several corpses. The game contains some suggestive material in the dialogue (e.g., “Might as well leave a sign out that reads, 'The men are out, come rape our women and children'”); in one sequence, a video depicts a man zipping up his pants and a woman buttoning up her blouse. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in dialogue."

Players use firearms (assault rifles, shotguns, pistols), hand-to-hand weapons (fists, knives, clubs), and stealth moves (e.g., neck-snapping, strangulation, and throat-slashing) to kill security personnel, hostile prisoners, and humanoid mutants. Some kills can result in enemies getting stabbed in the eye or being dismembered, resulting in limbs that explode and litter the ground. Red blood often splatters on the environment when enemies are attacked or killed. Players can also encounter a character that masturbates in his prison cell. Although the character's back faces the player during the act, the sequence lasts for about 45 seconds and involves some moaning and shuddering. Dialogue within cutscenes contains some sexual references (e.g., rape and necrophilia) and strong use of profanity (e.g., \"f*ck,\"\"c*nt,\" and \"p*ssies\")."

Throughout the course of the game, players will encounter enemies, triggering combat sequences in which the players will morph into a 'real' version of the costume they are wearing (e.g., a robot, a knight). Combat is controlled by are by pressing button sequences corresponding to on-screen prompts. Sound effects associated with battle are realistic at times.

One sequence allows players to perform an autopsy; other scenes involve clinical depictions of bruises, cuts, and evidence of foul play. A handful of scenes contain instances of violence: a character shooting himself in the head with a pistol; a woman drinking poison to commit suicide. One storyline involves an opium den which contains pipes, balls of the drug, and a brief depiction of white powder described as being “like cocaine.”"

    "synopsis": "This is a puzzle-adventure game in which players follow high-school students attempting to escape from a robot-bear captor. As players navigate the school, they sometimes come upon various corpses. Players investigate the various crime scenes, looking for clues and interviewing rival classmates. Finding the killer can trigger “punishment” cutscenes, in which acts of violence are depicted: students killed by a pitching machine, run over by a truck, crushed to death. There are also depictions of characters getting impaled by spikes and knives. Blood is frequently depicted on and around dead bodies. During the course of the game, the dialogue contains suggestive material (e.g., “Like I'd w-want to go anywhere with a dirty slut like you,” “It's not some pervy 'adult' video or anything” and “He...abused me...And he...he took pictures”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the game."

The game includes several comical depictions of characters, including a scene in which a 'Meathook' character turns his back to the camera to reveal a slightly exposed buttocks (e.g., 'plumber's crack'). During a sword fight, one of the characters uses a suggestive metaphor to describe battle (e.g., 'Sword fighting is kinda like making love. It's not always what you do, it's what you say.'). While players have no direct control over the sword combat, they can sometimes make/hear comments such as 'prepare to die' and 'I will milk every drop of blood from your body.' One character is depicted with a cigar in his mouth, and another character discusses how rum is an ingredient in a grog mixture. "

Players undertake missions/quests that increase characters' skills, eliminate an assortment of mutant creatures, and drive and collide with advanced alien vehicles. Players kill hundreds of enemies (e.g., human bandits and mercenary soldiers) over the course of the game by using a wide variety of guns (shotguns, sniper rifles), explosives, and special ammo types (fire, acid and electricity, etc.). The combat is frenetic, and enemies moan or scream when they are hit. Damage from weapons also results in large spurts of blood, dismemberment, and decapitation. When a human or creature is decapitated, an effect resembling a fountain of blood will shoot from the neck for a few seconds and stop. Some weapons cause enemies to split in half, the top being separated from the waist. During the course of the game, characters make jokes about streaking, body parts, rape, and mothers (e.g., '…more busted than my momma's girly parts'). Strong profanity (e.g., 'f*cking,' 'sh*t,' 'p*ssy,' and 'd*ckbag') can be heard in the dialogue."

Players use their fists, shotguns, machine guns, and chainsaws to kill an assortment of humans and monsters. Enemies explode into bloody chunks of flesh when killed. Enemy corpses remain on the ground, sometimes appearing as bloody piles of bones, blood, and viscera. Though the graphics are somewhat minimal (mid-90s renderings), several game levels depict pools of blood, mutilated bodies hanging from ceilings, with creatures' guts spilling out."

    "synopsis": "This is a racing simulation game in which players compete with real-world cars at the fictional Horizon Festival in Southern Europe. Players can race in various modes (e.g., Circuit, Point-to-Point, Street) to earn skill/experience points and unlock new customizable cars. Opening cutscenes contain brief images of women wearing revealing outfits (e.g., bikini tops, short-shorts), including depictions close-up or with panned camera angles. In-game dialogue is sometimes suggestive: “Oh, girls, girls, girls. Behave yourselves now – come on!” “[I'm] hearing some scandalous stories . . . Come on, send me photos.” During the course of the game, car-tag modes depict car collisions and include text/voice-overs such as “If you wanna become the king, you need to hit that driver with your car,” “Wreckage,” and “You're infected, crash into the survivors!” Accompanying song lyrics contain references to alcohol (e.g., “He had a still . . . his tumbler filled with gin”), suggestive behavior (e.g., “I wish I could love you down right now on the kitchen floor”), violence (e.g., “But if you want me to kill you, I would kill you”), and the word “damn.”"

Battles are accompanied by cries of pain, slashing sounds, and large splashes of blood that stain Alice's body and the ground. Some enemies can be decapitated, and certain attacks cause them to explode into pieces; in one sequence, young doll-like characters are depicted with bloody wounds that expose their brains. During the course of the game, the dialogue contains occasional references to prostitution (e.g., \"I saw you down at the bloody whore house,\"\"Where'd she be without me? On the streets selling her backside,\" and \"Where's me money?\"/\"Get those fat-a*s whores out on the street . . .\"). The words \"f**k\" and \"c*nt\" can be heard in dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an 'open-world' action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Cole Phelps, a rookie detective on a mission to stop a deranged serial killer. Set in late 1940s Los Angeles, the game allows players to advance through various 'desks' at a police department (i.e., Patrol, Traffic Squad, Homicide, Vice, Arson) by interviewing witnesses and suspects, searching crime scenes for clues, and apprehending criminals. Players use pistols, rifles, machine guns, and flamethrowers to engage in firefights with various enemies—these shootouts are highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood spurts that stain injured characters and the surrounding environment. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence, including a character being beaten with a crowbar (off screen)—large spurts of blood are depicted in the foreground. During the course of the game, players may come across crime scenes in which badly beaten or mutilated corpses are subject to investigation; players are able to examine victims' bodies close-up, surveying various bruises and bloody cuts for evidence—a few female corpses are depicted fully nude with fleeting images of pubic hair. Investigations sometimes pertain to sexual assault crimes, and details are often conveyed in clinical terms through dialogue or on-screen text (e.g., 'He's some kind of sex fiend,' 'Woman's briefs torn at seams, forcibly removed,' and 'Head trauma . . . external bruising to genitals.'). In one cutscene, there is an implication that a character is engaged in a sexual relationship with a teenager (e.g., 'You take love where you can find it as you get older, Jack'/That has nothing to do with love . . .'). Some sequences allow players to collect/manipulate drug-related evidence such as marijuana packets, morphine syringes, or amphetamine pills; in one cutscene, a doctor can be seen injecting a character with morphine. Language such as 'f**k,' 'sh*t,' 'c*nt,' 'n**ger,' and 'sp*c' can be heard in the dialogue."

In one game mode, players' unsuccessful attempts in competition may cause passengers to get flung from their seats. In Demolition-Expert mode, players must cause property damage to earn points: buildings are depicted crumbling and toppling over as pedestrians scream and scurry away from damage. Although human characters are never seriously injured, several stages depict loud crashing sounds, explosions, and screaming."

Combat is frenetic and highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and 'flesh-impact' sounds. During one sequence, players can use an axe to chop off the heads and arms of enemies. Blood often sprays from the bodies of injured soldiers and stains the ground near enemy corpses. Some profanity (e.g., 'sh*t') can be heard in the dialogue."

Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, fantasy weapons, and explosives to kill enemy soldiers and robotic characters. Players can also sneak up on enemies, stab them repeatedly, or slash their throats with a knife. Some weapons allow players to blow up enemies, resulting in chunks of flesh/blood strewn around game environments; large robots/mech suits sometimes crush enemies' heads or bodies. A handful of sequences depict bodies incinerated/mutilated by torture devices. During the course of the game, characters sometimes engage in sexual activity (e.g., a man thrusting against a woman on a table; a woman gyrating on top of a man in bed—camera angles largely obscure the sex act and no nudity is depicted.). The game includes a sequence in which two characters ingest a hallucinogenic drug from a liquid dropper; the screen becomes blurry and distorted. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue."

Presented from a top-down perspective, the game allows players to fight a variety of demigods and creatures on maze-like battlefields that hover above fire, amidst clouds, and sometimes within dungeon-like atmospheres. Players can summon and direct their characters to use colorful magic attacks or battle creatures/demigods with hammers, swords, and axes. Green blood sometimes splashes from wounded creatures, and dark red stains are scattered throughout the environment. One female demigod is shown wearing a provocative outfit that barely covers her breasts and buttocks; her breasts sometimes bounce when she moves, and she occasionally makes suggestive comments (e.g., 'My eyes are up here' or 'Aren't you even a little tempted?'). Some character biographies contain brief references to infidelity, murder, and 'drunken debauchery.'"

Some female characters are depicted in the game wearing low-cut outfits that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage; the dialogue also contains some suggestive references (e.g., 'Your mother seduced Montbarron?' and 'We will seduce a foreign man, but only if he is strong . . . clever . . . handsome.').

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter featuring two modes of gameplay: single player, in which players control soldiers on a mission to stop terrorists; and multiplayer, in which players engage in team-based combat ('Conquest,' 'Rush,' 'Squad Rush,' and 'Squad Death Match'). Both modes involve using machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, and rockets to kill enemy soldiers on the battlefield. In single-player mode, players conduct missions on an unnamed Japanese island during World War II and then move into the modern day through jungles, deserts, and snowy terrain. The firefights contain realistic gunfire, loud explosions, cries of pain; large sprays of blood come out of injured characters during the fast-paced combat. There are also close-up depictions of knife-stabbing (flesh-impact sounds) and melee attacks with a power drill. Multiplayer mode tends to involve more goal-oriented tasks, such as 'capturing-the-flag,' destroying and defending crates, point-based fighting. Characters use profanity (e.g., 'f**k,' 'sh*t,' and 'a*shole') during cutscenes and in the heat of battle."

As players navigate the island, they sometimes come upon corpses of murdered classmates. Players investigate the various crime scenes, looking for clues and interviewing fellow survivors.

A handful of still-frame cutscenes also depict characters impaled by spikes and hanging from ceilings. Blood is sometimes depicted on and around corpses. Cutscenes also depict female characters dressed in low-cut outfits and bikinis that expose large amounts of cleavage; these still images occassionally depict characters in provocative poses, with the camera focusing on pelvic areas. Some scenes contain sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., “That creep rubbed his ham-hands all over me and called it a body check! More like sexual harassment!” “My loins are still full of poison, and I'd appreciate it if you could suck it out…” and “some even tried to have children with Junko's dead body”).

Players complete mission-based objectives to increase their character's skills (e.g., stealth, strength) and advance the main storyline. Players use pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and explosives to kill a variety of human enemies (e.g., soldiers, police officers, gang members, drug dealers). Players can also use stealth attacks (e.g., choking, electrocution) to dispatch enemies at close range. Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, explosions, and large sprays of blood that stain the surrounding environment. Players can sometimes make choices that result in the death of innocent characters: during one sequence, an injured man asks to be “put out of his misery”—the main character can then administer a morphine overdose. Civilians can also be killed directly, though this may negatively affect players' progress. As the game progresses, alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer, vodka, cocktails) can be purchased and consumed to reduce damage, resulting in a screen-blurring effect. In one mission, players can plant “illegal drugs” in a character's residence; marijuana products (i.e., “cigaweed”) are occasionally referenced in the dialogue. Some missions contain sexual material: a brothel room containing a sex toy on the bed; dialogue with prostitutes (e.g., “They want me to get augmentations . . . for the customer's pleasure. It's sick” and “[W]e can find a quiet spot . . . Do you have enough money for me, sexy?”). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

Cutscenes also depict instances of blood: blood dripping from s man's head and mouth; blood-splash effects appearing during sword battle. During the course of the game, the dialogue contains references to suggestive/sexual material: “Sorry, Jude. I'm not that into bondage play;” “But it is true that some people can only experience true intimacy when they're tied and bound;” “[I] read it in a book. It was called 'Men and Women Beneath the Sheets.'' Some female characters are depicted in revealing outfits (e.g., deep cleavage), and their breasts may jiggle in exaggerated fashion. Characters sometimes discuss wine and drinking (e.g.,“This is porange wine. It's a type of liquor that glows in the dark.”); one scene depicts a character slurring her speech and falling over after tasting wine from a barrel. The words “bastard,” and “dumba*s” appear occasionally in dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a wrestling simulation game in which players can select real-world competitors from the WWE roster, compete in matches, and progress through multiple storylines. Players perform a variety of wrestling moves (e.g., grapples, holds, throws), as well as punching and kicking attacks. Sledgehammers, chairs, and tables can also be used to strike opponents; blood sometimes appears on wrestlers' faces. Some women are depicted in outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; female wrestlers occasionally make provocative gestures (e.g., pelvic thrusts, wiggling their buttocks in front of opponents' faces as a taunt). During the course of the game, a handful of sequences depict/reference alcohol: a wrestler wearing a “Drink Beer” shirt and spraying his opponents with a “beer truck” hose; a wrestler drinking from beer cans. One video clip briefly depicts the word “sh*t” on a fan's sign, and a wrestler can be seen sticking out his middle fingers."

The dialogue sometimes contains references to suggestive material (e.g., “They…fornicate with sheep when they get the chance,” “Nice dress. It'll look better on my bedroom floor,” and “Is that a bread roll in your toga or are you just pleased to see me?”). Alcohol is also referenced in the text/dialogue (e.g., “I wish I had some wine with us” and “Over there are Gauls, mead-drunk, blood-drunk”). The word “sh*t” can be heard in dialogue."

If an alien “implants” an egg into a dead human, the character will eventually explode amid additional gibbing effects. Some scenes depict dead or dying soldiers whose bodies are burned or mutilated. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players mostly punch and kick opponents during fast-paced rounds of combat. Some fighters use special attacks involving swords, throwing weapons, or magic; matches are accompanied by battle cries and exaggerated impact effects. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence, such as characters getting struck down with swords in slow motion. Most female fighters are dressed in revealing outfits (large amounts of cleavage); their breasts sometimes jiggle while standing or fighting. Some bikini-style costumes (with thin strips of cloth) barely cover fighters' bodies, exposing large amounts of breasts/buttocks; one hologram-like figure appears to be nude—though her reflective skin obscures any discernible details (i.e., nipples or genitalia). In Photo mode, players can zoom in on fighters' cleavage or underwear as they pose for the camera. Some scenes are coupled with sexual innuendo (e.g., “Pleasure me,” “Enough with the foreplay.”)."

Kiss me 'til you're drunk,” “Hey, sexy boy, set me free/Don't be shy, play with me/My dirty boy, can't you see”). Some lyrics also reference alcohol (e.g., “All I need is some vodka . . .” and “She never drinks the water/Makes you order French champagne”). In one comical dance sequence, a cartoony character (a rabbid) removes its tight shorts (no nudity is depicted)."

Players use pistols, shotguns, explosives, and a variety of melee weapons (e.g., pipes, sledgehammers, machetes, chainsaws) to kill enemy soldiers and boss characters. Though depicted in a “cartoony” art style, many attacks trigger over-the-top acts of violence: slitting enemies' throats; impaling them on weapons; shoving live grenades into their mouths. Battles are highlighted by frantic screams, exaggerated splashes of bright red blood, and corpses that litter the ground. Cutscenes depict intense acts of violence: characters getting stabbed in the eye; dismembered or decapitated close-up; slashed open, causing intestines to spill out. Some female characters are dressed in revealing outfits; one close-up shot depicts characters' jiggling breasts. In one cutscene, a character mentions an army that has taken over the drug-smuggling practices of nearby cartels. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue. "

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of a marine on a mission to stop a demonic invasion on Mars. Players use pistols, shotguns, rocket launchers, and chainsaws to kill mutant enemies and demonic creatures. Large blood-splatter effects occur frequently as enemies get decapitated and/or dismembered during combat; a handful of sequences depict mutilated corpses with exposed organs/viscera strewn in the environment. Some attacks result in finishing sequences that depict intense acts of violence: players using a chainsaw to slice open an enemy's head; players ripping the heart out of a creature and shoving it in its mouth; players sticking a gun in a creature's mouth and pulling the trigger. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the dialogue."

As dictator (“El Presidente”), players can order their officers to assassinate rebellious citizens. Players can also command soldiers and tanks to quash rebel uprisings or protests; these conflicts are accompanied by realistic gunfire and small explosions. Events occasionally reference suggestive material: “Your family's rather rollicking love life has lead to an unexpected pregnancy”; “…picture me drinking a glass of milk as it runs down my chin from my big soft lips”; “Go, have fun, do the mile high!” The dialogue also contains references to alcohol (e.g., “A preacher I once knew vowed to drink any and all alcoholic beverages he can find…”; “I also wrote their demands on my hand so as not to forget them when I got drunk”). Players can grow tobacco, as well as build cigar factories and rum distilleries in order to create export industries. The word “bastard” appears in dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a rhythm game in which players follow a group of students through a mystery involving a strange website and a group of pop stars. Players match timed button presses to on-screen prompts in order to dance their way through confrontations with creatures (e.g., shadow monsters, marionettes, robots). A handful of cutscenes depict brief instances of violence: a still image of a man shooting another character (blood stains the victim's shirt); a figure in silhouette hanging herself. The game also contains suggestive material: characters wearing revealing outfits (e.g., deep cleavage); characters discussing the sex appeal of other female characters (e.g.,“Her chest is like, BAM, while her waist is so slim!”; “I love how she seems so…seductive”). One cutscene briefly depicts a female character in the shower, with steam/mist partially covering her chest. The word “sh*t” is heard in the dialogue."

A handful of sequences also depict additional acts of violence: a vampire stabbed (off-screen) in the chest with a stake; characters turned to dust in a fiery blast. The game contains some suggestive material: female character in outfits that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage; dialogue that states, “On the one hand, he must flirt with all the ladies” and “Oh, this one's a tasty morsel! I'd love to get my tentacles around her . . .” The game includes a brief reference to alcohol in a character description: \"A consummate connoisseur, it pairs fine wines with the brains it devours.\" The word “hell” appears in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a third-person shooter in which players assume the role of an undercover police officer who must infiltrate a crime organization in Hong Kong. As players complete missions to earn experience points and advance the plot, they use knives, meat cleavers, assault rifles, grenades, and other weapons to kill human enemies (e.g., armed/unarmed thugs, gang members). Hand-to-hand combat is a major component of gameplay: players can perform “environmental kills” such as throwing enemies into an ice chipper, pushing their heads into a table saw, impaling them on elevated meat hooks—these sequences are accompanied by slow-motion effects, exaggerated blood splatter, and scattered body parts. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence (e.g., unarmed characters getting shot at point-blank range; a restrained character being tortured with a razor and power drill). The game contains sexual material, which can be heard in the dialogue (e.g., “Hey, tell your sister to give me a call, huh? I wouldn't mind giving her a mouthful,” “Tell Ming to stick with girls over 14 this time,” The triads use those places as whorehouses”). In one sequence, a woman is briefly shown reaching for a man's crotch (both characters are fully clothed); in another, players can use in-game credits to make “massage parlor” purchases (the screen fades to black). Drug use is referenced several times, and a handful of cut scenes depict characters snorting illicit substances. Words such as “f**k,” “c*nt,” and “sh*t” can be heard in dialogue."

Characters screech or cry out in pain when hit, and often break apart into smaller Lego pieces when defeated. Players sometimes engage in one-on-one wand duels that are accompanied by colorful explosions. In one cutscene, a character's body explodes, and the central character cradles the head piece; another sequence depicts a dragon impaled through the mouth by a sword. In one sequence, brown Lego droppings fall out of a creature's posterior; a character scoops up the droppings with a shovel and remarks with a comical “Pee-ewhh” gesture."

    "synopsis": "This is a real-time strategy game in which players assume the role of a commander of one of three intergalactic factions. From an overhead perspective, players control an armored command unit on a vast battlefield. This main base is essentially a giant piloted robot, and it is the hub from which players use their resource management skills and strategic planning to survive the futuristic battles. Players can launch missiles, dispatch soldiers, position robots and tanks, and release laser fire to defeat enemy units. In some sequences, robots and structures explode in a flurry of small laser blasts. Occasionally, soldiers within the robotic armor can be seen reacting with pain when attacked. Branching storylines depict dramatic scenes: space battles in which ships and stations explode, buildings laid in waste, factories set ablaze, soldiers mourning comrades at lonely tombstones. Though laser fire gets frenetic, and the themes are sometimes heavy, players are essentially building, salvaging, guarding, and dispatching—actions dictated by commands, a viewpoint that is somewhat detached (bird's-eye view of the grid-like landscape)."

    "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of Velvet Crowe, a warrior on a quest for vengeance against an evil lord. As players explore towns and fields, they can interact and recruit additional characters to help battle enemy soldiers and fantastical creatures (e.g., dragons, werewolves, lizard men) in melee-style combat. Players use swords, lances, pistols, and magic spells to defeat enemies. Battles are frenetic, highlighted by impact sounds and cries of pain. Cutscenes also show acts of violence: a man impaled with a sword; a man repeatedly shooting himself in the head. Some sequences depict blood stains on characters' bodies and/or clothing. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters and creatures depicted partially nude (no genitalia or nipples are seen); suggestive references in the dialogue (e.g., “You mean it feels good to get whipped,” “Your butt is a bit bulky,” and “Eating lots of vegetables will give you bazongas”). During the course of the game, some characters are depicted drinking alcohol, slurring their speech, and discussing drinking (e.g., \"If you guys are going to have a drinking contest, you're going to need some snacks to go with all that alcohol, right?\"). The words “a*s” and “bastard” appear in dialogue."

From first- and third-person perspectives, players use machine guns, scoped rifles, trip mines, and grenades to kill enemy soldiers and complete mission objectives. Players employ stealth tactics to dispatch enemies from various ranges (e.g., crouching behind rubble to take a shot; sneaking up and stabbing enemies). Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, explosions, and large splashes of blood. Performing accurate shots sometimes triggers a “kill cam,” which follows the bullet in slow motion to its intended target. These sequences depict X-ray views of enemies' bones, ligaments, and organs shattering or bursting apart. The word “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

As players traverse through mountainous open-world environments, they complete missions and quests that impact the eventual fate of their character. Players use swords, bows and arrows, axes, and magic attacks (e.g., fireballs, ice shards) to kill various enemies (e.g., wolves, dragons, human bandits and soldiers). As players engage in melee-style combat, some sequences are highlighted by slow-motion effects, particularly for decapitations. Large blood-splatter effects also occur during combat, and some environments are stained with blood or body parts (e.g., heads impaled on spikes). Some sequences allow players to injure/kill nonadversary characters, including prisoners chained to a wall; they scream in pain amid splashes of blood or fire. As the game progresses, the dialogue and on-screen text contains references to sexual material (e.g., “. . . all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires,” “She . . . raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her,” and “Remember when you thought [he] was . . . intent on making you . . . into his personal sex slave?”). Alcohol such as wine, mead, and ale can be purchased and consumed by players' character throughout the game; in one sequence, players can engage in a drinking contest with another character, which eventually results in slurred speech (e.g., “One more. No problemsh . . . Thash grape!”)."

From a third-person perspective, players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and various tools (e.g., poisons, cleavers, explosives) to assassinate human characters. Players can also use stealth attacks (e.g., strangling characters with wires) to eliminate targets and guards at close range.

Large blood-splatter effects often occur, and pools of blood appear under victims' bodies. During the course of the game, some female characters are seen unconscious and dragged by players' character; their underwear and portions of their buttocks are sometimes depicted. The dialogue also contains suggestive material (e.g., \"Go get yourself laid or something,\" \"I'm a wh*re,\" and \"...move your pelvis back and forth and in and out.\").

Players use a wide variety of weapons such as pistols, rifles, machine guns, and explosives to injure/kill enemies. Combat can generate pools of blood and dismembered limbs. Players can use enemy bodies as human shields and execute them at close range. In one sequence, broken glass is placed into the mouth of a man while he is repeatedly punched, causing blood to spill from his mouth. Language such as \"f**k,\"\"b*tch,\" and \"sh*t\" can be heard in the dialogue."

Instead of actually engaging in combat, Guybrush attacks some characters by poking and prodding \"cartoony\" voodoo dolls. In one scene he rips off the leg of a voodoo doll, causing a zombie pirate to lose his arm and leg and spew out splashes of green blood. To solve one of the puzzles, players must compete in a drinking contest during which a character is depicted drinking a mug of grog. The grog is described as having \"twice the alcohol, twice the calories,\" and causes the character to pass out. There is also a scene that depicts a man spitting out green mucus, and players can compete in a spitting contest. The word \"hell\" can be heard once in the dialogue (\"What the hell?\")."

    "synopsis": "Players assume the roles of heroes caught in a war between two opposing forces in this fantasy role-playing game. Players travel between the planet Pulse and a moon named Cocoon to engage in missions for magical beings called the \"fal'Cie.\" Missions involve battling enemy soldiers and creatures by using melee attacks (swords, knives, staffs, etc.), firearms, and magic spells (lightning strikes, fire blasts, etc.). Combat is executed through a modified turn-based system in which players select various commands from a menu while freely moving one of three heroes through the battlefield. Players can also summon elemental creatures to battle an assortment of goblins, golems, zombies, wolves, frogs, bats, and robots. The game's cinematic cutscenes contain the most intense depictions of violence: machine gunfire from space ships strafe human characters below; humans and robotic soldiers exchange gunfire—aboard vessels, on the ground; a slow-motion gunfight depicts the cracked lens of a robot shot in the head by two semi-automatics. Cutscenes occasionally depict female characters dressed in revealing outfits: Holographic dancers—clad in bikini tops, skimpy leotards, and backless chaps—glide above the city during a festivity performance; flying-motorcycle models wear skin-tight tops that expose deep cleavage. And during one elaborate sequence, a female character transforms from a crystal statue back to her human form—sparkle effects, camera panning, and shimmering lights partially obscure the nude character, though side-portions of her breasts are visible (fleeting—one-to-two seconds). The game also contains the expletives \"a*s,\"\"damn,\" and \"hell\"; however, it is the violent content, the suggestive themes that account for the Teen rating."

Players must assemble a team of henchmen, command a space ship, and travel to distant planets across a futuristic galaxy. At its core, the game involves a combination of conversation/interaction with characters, and ground-based (i.e., \"run-and-gun\") space battle: Players use assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and pistols to kill humans, robots, and aliens in the frenetic third-person firefights. Some enemies emit large splashes of blood when shot (particularly with \"head shots\"); several enemies lie stagnant in pools of blood—factors for the Mature rating. Henchmen are able to freeze and shatter enemies, engage in melee attacks, set robots on fire, and use telekinesis to disable aliens. A handful of cutscenes depict dramatic interrogations in which human characters are threatened, punched, kicked, and shot (in the leg) by alien creatures. The game contains themes of illicit drug use, addiction, and trafficking—often focal points to the branching storylines; for example, \"Morinth likes dancing while on a drug called Hallex,\"\"Narcotics flooded my veins when I attacked,\" and \"The asari injecting so many drugs into me was terrifying.\" During the course of the game, players may enter a bar where alien pole dancing exists (choreography highlighted on big-screen monitors) or hear suggestive comments such as \" krogan  sexual deviants enjoy  salarian  flexibility\" and\"if this is just about sex, maybe you should just  f**king  say so.\" [Italics added] Players can also choose to have \"romantic encounters\" with the alien/human henchmen characters; this involves watching a guided cutscene in which two characters flirt, kiss, and/or embrace: clothed alien/human characters may prop a partner on top of a space console, clear away the clutter from a bed-slab, unzip a future-blouse, or just talk it out. Though an alien/human may gyrate her hips while on top (fleeting—one-to-two seconds), actual sexis never depicted—the cameracuts awaytospace furniture and ceilings."

Some female characters are dressed in revealing outfits (e.g., skin-tight leather, lingerie, showgirl costumes), and players can enter a \"Peep Show\" or receive a \"Peeping Tom\" bonus. Some missions involve making, serving, and drinking alcoholic beverages (e.g., wine, vodka, and whiskey); if players drink too much alcohol, their movements may become erratic and they may vomit. The dialogue includes language such as \"sh*t\" and \"b*tch.\""

    "synopsis": "This is a strategy game in which players manage a nation from a single settlement to a prominent civilization. Players can develop their nation's culture and technology, manage its economic and social infrastructure (e.g., diplomacy, trade), and expand territory through military conquests. Combat with nations is presented from an overhead perspective, and military units are represented by small armies of soldiers on a gridded map. Battles include brief animations of sword fighting, gun fights, and vehicular combat, resulting in icons exploding, collapsing, or disappearing. Nuclear weapons can be developed and detonated over opposing nation's territories. Historically based text includes descriptions of violence (e.g., assassinations, murders, suicides) and a reference to the opium drug trade (e.g., \"where they could engage in extremely profitable business including the infamous opium trade.\")."

    "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game, set in a post-apocalyptic Mojave Desert, in which players assume the role of a survivor hero who investigates a mystery and performs a series of quests. Missions allow players to explore the Mojave Desert, surrounding casinos, and abandoned facilities; other quests involve combat with human and mutant survivors. Players use chainsaws, laser rifles, knives, and sledgehammers to kill enemies. Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of dismemberment, blood spray, and blood trails. In one sequence, players can choose to activate a collar bomb around a slave-woman's neck, resulting in depictions of blood and gore. During the course of the game, players will encounter male and female prostitutes: the screen fades to black as suggestive dialogue is heard in the background (e.g., \"Nice charlies, too! Give them a shake for the Ben-man, will ya?\"); there is also an extended sequence suggesting (no depiction) sexual activity with a robot (e.g., \"Fisto reporting for duty . . . Please assume the position,\"\"I suppose I should test you out . . . Servos active!\" and \"Something wrong with someone if they got to f**k a machine.\"). The storyline sometimes references a fictional drug called \"chems,\" as well as \"Day Trippers,\"\"cracked out junkies,\" and \"degenerate, drug-addicted killers.\" Players' Character can be seen consuming the drugs, which sometimes leads to a screen-blurring effect."

The dialogue contains some mild sexual references such as \"He says you are a psychotic dominatrix and not in the good way\"; \"Between the heart palpitations and the unchecked syphilis, it's the least of my worries\"; and \". . . mighty codpiece.

Players can socially interact with Sims to build relationships, and are free to pursue more intimate encounters, such as the ability to kiss, \"make out,\" or engage in WooHoo (i.e., sex) with another Sim: this action depicts the Sims squirming, giggling, and moaning under the covers until hearts float around the bed. Sims maintain their health and hygiene through eating, exercising, bathing, and using the toilet. They sometimes vomit, expel flatulent sounds, or urinate on themselves if their hygiene is not properly managed. Some interactions lead to fighting, which is depicted by sounds of struggle and partially obscured \"fight-cloud\" effects; other animations include Sims getting electrocuted by household appliances or dying in fires."

As players complete quests, they use swords and magic spells to kill enemy soldiers and fantastical creatures (e.g., specters, harpies, spider-like monsters) in melee-style combat; attacks are often accompanied by slashing sounds and screams of pain. Blood-splatter effects occur when enemies are hit, and damage sometimes results in dismemberment or decapitation—blood stains and body parts occasionally appear in the environment. Other cutscenes depict gore and more intense acts of violence: a close-up view of a severed head; a restrained woman's eyes getting gouged out (off-screen); a character being castrated (not depicted) before his throat is slit. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted topless; there is also a fleeting image of pubic hair as a woman dives into the water. Players can initiate brief cutscene sequences that depict varying degrees of sexual activity: a topless woman rocking on top of man; a man caressing a woman's back; a man pushing up against a woman's posterior—sexual moaning sounds can be heard, though the camera cuts away from explicit sexual acts. Some sequences depict a cocaine-like substance being cut into lines; another scene shows a man's back as he snorts the substance. Language such as \"f**k,\"\"sh*t,\" and \"c*nt\" can be heard in the dialogue."

Players assume the role of elite soldiers through counter terrorist and military missions, using pistols, machine guns, and rocket launchers to kill various enemies (e.g., human soldiers, giant robots). Players can also employ close-up stealth attacks (e.g., choking and slitting throats from behind) to defeat enemies. Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and blood-splatter effects (blood also stains the ground). Some games allow non-adversary characters/prisoners to be injured or killed; cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: enemy soldiers executed at point-blank range; a restrained character beaten during an interrogation. A comic-book-style sequence (hand-drawn still images) depicts a young character using a knife to execute captured soldiers. Some games in the collection include suggestive/sexual material: a man briefly groping a character's breasts; a male character's buttocks exposed as he runs through levels. In some sequences, players can enter a cardboard box (\"Love Pack\") to engage in sexual acts with another character—there is no depiction of the sexual acts, though moaning sounds occur. Players also have the ability to unlock a “Snake Beater” award after repeatedly zooming in on a picture of a woman in lingerie. A handful of sequences include depictions of bathroom humor (e.g., a character defecating inside his pants; a character urinating off a platform onto another character). The game includes references to drugs in the dialogue (e.g., “The biggest cocaine consume in the world is the United States\" and \"How'd he get the cocaine?\"). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in dialogue."

Players use swords, bows and arrows, axes, and magic attacks (e.g., fireballs, ice shards) to kill various enemies (e.g., wolves, dragons, human bandits and soldiers). As players engage in melee-style combat, some sequences are highlighted by slow-motion effects, particularly for decapitations. Large blood-splatter effects also occur during combat, and some environments are stained with blood or body parts (e.g., heads impaled on spikes). Some sequences allow players to injure/kill nonadversary characters, including prisoners chained to a wall; they scream in pain amid splashes of blood or fire. As the game progresses, the dialogue and on-screen text contains references to sexual material (e.g., “. . . all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires,”“She . . . raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her,” and “Remember when you thought [he] was . . . intent on making you . . . into his personal sex slave?”). Alcohol such as wine, mead, and ale can be purchased and consumed by players' character throughout the game; in one sequence, players can engage in a drinking contest with another character, which eventually results in slurred speech (e.g., “One more.

Players shoot bullets and artillery shells, release mustard gas, fire flamethrowers, and drop bombs on human-toy soldiers trying to enter players' toy box (home base). Players can also use machine guns, howitzers, tanks, and biplanes to assault the enemy's position. The molded plastic toys come apart into gears and springs, flail into the air (i.e., ragdoll physics), or fall over and fade away when defeated; some characters scream loudly when they are scorched by flamethrowers. While the overall context of plastic toy soldiers fighting in diorama boxes lessens the impact of the violence, the game is rated Teen because the depictions of battle are still frenetic and somewhat intense: players frequently hear realistic gunfire, see war through a sniper's periscope, and engage in a series of military strategies and tactics—artillery, barbed wire, chemical warfare, etc. The game also contains depictions of tobacco and multiple references to alcohol: cigarettes are among several \"unlcockable\" items in a display case (e.g., text states, \"Cigarettes are a soldier's most precious commodity\"); rum and beer are occasionally mentioned (e.g., \"Supply Reserve Depot Rum\"; \"Plenty good at finding rum jars\"; and \"Bottles of beer.

    "synopsis": "This is an action adventure/role-playing game that tells the story of Eddie Riggs, a roadie who is transported to a mythical world of heavy metal rock. Eddie is armed with a guitar and a double-headed axe, which players can use to slash and dismember enemies. Players can also perform \"face-melting solos\" (literally melting enemies' faces), meet humanoid creatures dressed like dominatrixes—brandishing whips—, and liberate an army of rockers from a life of oppression. Although the storyline is often irreverent and whimsical, the depictions of violence are somewhat intense: Undead humanoids are dismembered with an axe (sometimes in slow-motion); a \"Steel-Quilled Blade\" causes human enemies to explode into gibs that rain down; machine guns, missile launchers, and sub woofers can be used to kill druids and other fantastical creatures. Eddie can also run over dozens of enemies with his hot rod, resulting in blood effects and more heads and limbs getting chopped off. During the course of the game, characters sometimes engage in suggestive dialogue intended for comedic effect (e.g., \"Maybe with all your feedback, you guys could just blow me over the gorge\" and \"Playtime's over. Now let's get back to the orgy\"). Players will also encounter \"Skull Rakers\" clad in bondage gear and amazon-like warriors dressed in leather outfits that partially reveal buttocks and breasts. Strong profanity (e.g., \"f*ck,\"\"sh*t,\" and \"d*ck\") can be heard in the dialogue."

As players traverse through fantastical open-world environments, they use oversized blades to kill demonic/angelic creatures (e.g., dragons, golems, ice skeletons, “corrupted angels”). The melee-style combat is accompanied by screaming/flesh-rending sounds, bone-crunching effects, and exaggerated splashes of blood. Players can also initiate “cinematic kills” that depict additional violence: enemies getting impaled, decapitated, or dismembered (often amid slow-motion effects)—similar imagery can be seen during cutscenes. Some female characters (e.g., harpy-like creatures; a demon) are depicted with large amounts of exposed cleavage."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players control U.S. soldiers tasked with preventing an imminent terrorist attack. Players complete military mission objectives during the Cold War and in modern-day international locations (e.g., United States, Haiti, Afghanistan). Players use pistols, sniper rifles, machine guns, explosives, and melee attacks to kill enemy soldiers; the frenetic conflicts are highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood from injured characters. Blood stains are also depicted around corpses and in the surrounding environment. Some weapons result in decapitated bodies or dismembered limbs, and various attacks are accompanied by slow-motion effects. Other intense acts of violence include a soldier burned alive in a vehicle; a bound man shot in the kneecaps during an interrogation; a hostage's throat slit by a villain; an incapacitated soldier shot in the head at close range by the player. During the course of the game, players can navigate through a night club that depicts several silhouettes of female pole-dancers (e.g., the images gyrate provocatively in front of patrons). One mission depicts packages of cocaine in an underground drug factory; another brief sequence depicts cocaine use (e.g., white powder funneling into a rolled-up dollar bill). The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue."

Matches are highlighted by impact sounds, splashes of blood, and colorful light effects as fighters are hurled across the screen or to the ground.

Some super attacks depict blood-splatter effects as characters are injured by creatures and/or impaled with swords. Cutscenes depict additional instances of violence and blood: a character impaled with a sword; a prisoner lying in a small pool of blood; a character stabbed with a trident; a villain's throat slashed off-screen. The game's dialogue contains brief sexual references (e.g., \"They're thieves. Rapists. Murderers.”), and some female characters wear revealing outfits (e.g., deep cleavage, tight-fitting clothing) and/or perform suggestive poses. One fight setting takes place in a bar with several alcohol references: signs that read \"Beer\"'; drunk patrons in the background; kegs of beer that can be thrown at opponents.

It is probably no coincidence that the fighter who performs the Drunken Master Walk will wobble, lurch, and lose his balance as he fights.\r\n\r\nPlayers can access a wide range of customizable accessories for their characters; some of these items include outfits that expose portions of female fighters' lower breasts and buttocks. During a few cutscenes (where graphics tend to be enhanced), the camera briefly pans on their thighs, breasts, and buttocks; and during battle, when a female character is struck by an attack, her breasts will sometimes bounce. (There are no comparable physics applied to male characters.) The majority of cutscenes (including those above) introduce elements of irreverence and comic relief, though one sketch might be difficult to digest: pizza, laxatives—flatulence. The dialogue contains the expletives \"a*s,\" \"bastard,\" \"damn,\" and \"b*tch\"; it may also contain a line expressed by one of its feisty female characters—Asuka Kazama: \"If you're not gonna take me seriously, then I'll just have to give you a serious a*s-kicking.\""

    "synopsis": "This is a fighting game in which players engage in one-on-one combat with a large cast of human, animal, and supernatural characters. Players use martial-arts punches, kicks, and throws to drain opponents' life meters. Some characters can also use machine guns or throw fireballs at opponents. Cutscenes depict further instances of violence: a character throwing another person off a cliff into lava; a soldier shooting a character in the arm. Small blood splashes occasionally appear on the camera during cutscenes; one sequence depicts splashes of blood on a character's nose after being struck. The game contains includes some suggestive material: female characters wearing outfits that reveal deep cleavage (the camera occasionally zooms in on their chests); a male character peeking at a woman as she showers (no nudity is depicted); a man falling face first into a woman's chest. One cutscene involves pizza, laxatives, gurgling noises, and flatulence as two characters scramble to reach a bathroom. The words “a*s” and “bastard” appear in the dialogue."

Players also view cutscenes containing narratives about select prisoners; these cutscenes include comic-book still images of violent acts and depictions of blood (e.g., gunshot wounds; stabbings; bound hostages; murder victims). One prolonged sequence depicts a hostage situation in which prison staff members can be hurt and killed by inmates. One cutscene depicts still images of a man and a woman partially nude in bed; moaning sounds can be heard.

Players can occasionally ride atop horses through battlefields and engage in one-on-one magic duels. Cutscenes reenact other dramatic events from the movies (e.g., a warrior getting struck down by orcs; a wizard falling into a crevasse; armies fighting each other on the battlefield). A handful of sequences depict slapstick-style humor: a creature kicking a character in the crotch; a character sniffing his armpit; a character landing close to a pile of animal droppings."

As players explore ancient ruins in international locales, they can use stealth moves (e.g., neck-snapping, chokeholds) and melee attacks to incapacitate armed thugs and mercenaries; some fistfights are highlighted by bone-cracking sounds and slow-motion effects. Players also use realistic pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers, and grenades to kill nearby enemies. Injured characters emit small puffs of blood when shot, and some sequences depict individuals with bloodstained clothing. The words “sh*t,” “b*tch,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue."

As players explore international locations and ancient ruins, they use pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers, and grenades to kill various enemies (e.g., mercenaries, soldiers, pirates). Players can also employ melee attacks and stealth takedowns (e.g., choking and neck snapping) to incapacitate enemies. Firefights are highlighted by realistic gunfire, large explosions, and blood-splatter effects. During the course of the game, characters engage in suggestive innuendo (e.g., “So much for foreplay,” “Man interests in climax must be a real hit with the ladies,” and “Oh, is that an ancient Tibetan ritual dagger in your pocket?”). In one scene, a female character straddles Drake on his bed (both fully clothed) then kisses him before the camera pans away. A handful of sequences also depict characters smoking cigars and/or cigarettes. The word “sh*t” and “d*ck” are heard in the dialogue."

As players help Corvo exact revenge on those who betrayed him, they can use pistols, crossbows, swords, and grenades to kill human enemies in ranged and melee-style combat. Violence is sometimes accompanied by slow-motion effects and gurgling sounds from Corvo's victims. Certain weapons result in dismembered limbs, and attacks are accompanied by exaggerated blood-splatter effects. Some environments depict mutilated corpses on the ground or hanging from the ceiling. During one interactive sequence, Corvo brands a restrained man's cheek with a hot iron; in another, players use electric shocks to interrogate a blindfolded man in a chair. The game depicts some female characters in revealing outfits and includes some sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., “Hey sweetheart, you want to play with me? You're a lot cuter than my regulars,” “This one thinks only of whores,” and “Sell your wife into prostitution, I'm sure I can get you a good price.”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can also be heard in the game."

Some cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a bound man tortured with razorblades and spikes; a gangster's fingers sliced by a boss; a character shot in the face. Some missions allow players to become more intimate with female characters; as these relationships escalate, players can earn video clips of real women posing in lingerie, swimsuits, or partially nude in bathtubs (e.g., characters' nipples/genitalia barely covered by soap bubbles). During the course of the game, players can order and drink whiskey at bars/restaurants—a status icon indicates drunkenness; consuming alcoholic beverages provides minor bonuses in combat.

As players explore open-world Egyptian, Greek, and Roman environments they undertake missions to find, stalk, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, arrows, concealed blades, and spears to assassinate targets and kill enemies in frenetic melee-style combat. Some cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a man beaten to death with an orb; a child getting stabbed. Assassinations and fights are highlighted by cries of pain and large blood-splatter effects. One sequence depicts human body parts and blood in a cave; another scene briefly depicts a headless corpse impaled on a stake. The game includes a mission involving prostitutes and a brothel in which a couple can be partially observed having sex (i.e., moaning sounds). Female characters are sometimes depicted topless in the brothel; some rooms contain drawings of figures engaged in various sex acts. During the course of the game, a character briefly mentions an opium pipe. The player's character is depicted drinking alcohol during a sequence of cutscenes; after a time, players must walk and engage in a fistfight while the screen and controls are impaired. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “c*nt” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person action game in which players assume the role of a character (Billie Lurk) battling evil forces in a fictional world. Players use swords/knives, ranged weapons, explosives, and supernatural powers to kill enemy soldiers and thugs in frenetic combat. Enemies can be shot with spikes, stabbed in the head or chest, and slashed to death—resulting in large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks allow players to dismember or decapitate enemies; grenades and trap mines can blow enemies up into bursts of blood and limbs. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is visual novel in which players assume the role of a high-school student investigating a series of mysterious deaths in Tokyo. Some scenes depict still images of characters engaged in violent acts: characters threatening people with knives, strangling other characters, and involved in torture devices (e.g., a corpse strangled by ropes until its neck snaps). Crime scenes are graphically depicted with extensive blood-splatter and large amounts of text detail. Corpses are frequently depicted with bloodstains and sometimes mangled fingers, dangling entrails, or exposed brains. The game also contains sexual material, in still images and text: two female characters moaning off screen while discussing each other's breasts (e.g., “Hmm…you've got big breasts, don't you Hana?”); a dream sequence in which a character grabs another's crotch (e.g., “Was I really dreaming about someone rubbing my crotch?”); prolonged innuendo about an ice cream cone (e.g., “I saw her tongue flick seductively for a moment before her tiny mouth swallowed the whole thing.”); references to sexual fetishes and masturbation. Still images also depict partially exposed breasts and buttocks. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in dialogue."

As players explore the academy's hallways and rooms, they investigate the murders of several characters, searching for clues in order to judge/punish the killers. Players engage in a variety of mini-games to analyze evidence and organize clues. In addition to the depiction of bloody corpses in several scenes, players are able to trigger elaborate “punishment” cutscenes in which intense acts of violence are depicted: students boiled/burned to death, sliced by saw blades, hung by the neck, set on fire, stabbed through the chest by giant insects. Blood is frequently depicted during these cutscenes and gameplay. Some scenes contain sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., “Think of me during your next tug session!”; “Hey crotchrot, you staring at my t*ts?”; “The kinda stuff that gives me a raging b*ner!”; “By day you're fingerin' the piano keys, by night the dudes are fingerin'...\"). A handful of scenes depict partially nude figures with exposed buttocks and breasts. Dialogue briefly mentions drug use (e.g., “I need strong meds cuz I wanna trip...”; I'm jonesing for a leaf!“; “You can't use drugs to get high!”). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in dialogue."

As players help B.J. and his comrades escape various situations, they use traditional and futuristic firearms (e.g., pistols, shotguns, laser blasters, grenade launchers) to kill enemy soldiers and larger mechanized units. Combat is frenetic, with realistic gunfire, explosions, screams of pain, and large blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to blow off enemies' heads or cut off their limbs; cutscenes sometimes show decapitations and/or acts of disembowelment. One scene briefly depicts a clothed couple engaging in sexual activity (a character straddling another); moaning sounds can be heard before the couple appears on screen. A handful of scenes depict female characters with exposed breasts: a woman breastfeeding a baby; a woman's shirt getting torn off during a firefight. During the course of the game, a character is seen ingesting a hallucinogenic drug (e.g., sheet of acid, tab of LSD); both sequences involve instances of hallucination. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “n*gger” appear in the dialogue."

Players use handguns, rifles, machine guns, and knives to kill hordes of zombies and mutated creatures. Battles are highlighted by screams of pain and realistic gunfire; enemies often dissolve into pools of blood and chunks of flesh when killed. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently when humans or zombies are attacked, and some characters are depicted with exposed organs/viscera. In one level, a human character is seen getting thrown into a glass partition, resulting in a large splatter of blood. The word “sh*t” appears in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an open-world action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Cole Phelps, a rookie detective on a mission to stop a deranged serial killer. Set in late 1940s Los Angeles, the game allows players to advance through various \"desks\" at a police department (i.e., Patrol, Traffic Squad, Homicide, Vice, Arson) by interviewing witnesses and suspects, searching crime scenes for clues, and apprehending criminals. Players use pistols, rifles, machine guns, and flamethrowers to engage in firefights with various enemies—these shootouts are highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood spurts that stain injured characters and the surrounding environment. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence, including a character being beaten with a crowbar (off screen)—large spurts of blood are depicted in the foreground. During the course of the game, players may come across crime scenes in which badly beaten or mutilated corpses are subject to investigation; players are able to examine victims' bodies close-up, surveying various bruises and bloody cuts for evidence—a few female corpses are depicted fully nude with fleeting images of pubic hair. Investigations sometimes pertain to sexual assault crimes, and details are often conveyed in clinical terms through dialogue or on-screen text (e.g., \"He's some kind of sex fiend,\" \"Woman's briefs torn at seams, forcibly removed,\" and \"Head trauma...external bruising to genitals.\"). In one cutscene, there is an implication that a character is engaged in a sexual relationship with a teenager (e.g., \"You take love where you can find it as you get older, Jack\"/That has nothing to do with love...\"). Some sequences allow players to collect/manipulate drug-related evidence such as marijuana packets, morphine syringes, or barbiturate pills; in one sequence, players can examine overdose victims shown with needle marks, rubber-hose tourniquets, and nearby syringes. The words “f**k,” “c*nt,” “sh*t,” “n*gger,” \"sp*c,\" and “k*ke” appear in dialogue."

As players explore themed areas of the “Metaverse,” they engage in turn-based combat against fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, evil spirits, shadow creatures). Characters use blades, pipes, firearms, and Personas (i.e., creatures that enable magical attacks) to defeat enemies; battles are highlighted by light effects, impact sounds, and cries of pain. Some cutscenes depict characters ripping masks off their faces as blood sprays. One cutscene depicts a man shooting another character in the head at close range; blood is shown pooling on the floor and splattering the victim's clothes. Several female monsters/Personas are depicted with exposed breasts, and a handful of creatures have phallic-shaped heads, torsos, or appendages. Various Personas (e.g., Succubus, Incubus) have sexual characteristics that are described in text (e.g., “They visit sleeping men/women and have sexual intercourse with them”); dialogue also includes sexual references (e.g., “Apparently he's been forcing young idols and other girls to have sex with him to move up in the ranks”). Drug smuggling for the mafia is briefly discussed during a side quest (e.g., “Like illegal drugs…? Maybe they made Iida smuggle drugs for them.”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a woman on a quest to uncover the secrets of her past. As players manipulate gravity to traverse through fantastical environments, they engage in hand-to-hand combat with blob-like creatures (i.e., Nevi) that break apart and disappear when defeated. Players can also throw various projectiles (e.g., boxes, furniture, crystals) at nearby enemies; battles are highlighted by cries of pain and colorful light effects. Some cutscenes contain other instances of violence: a character beating up armed thugs; a girl getting “eaten” (i.e., absorbed) by a large Nevi. During the course of the game, some female characters wear revealing outfits, and one still-frame cutscene depicts a woman covering her breasts after dropping a towel. Several gallery images depict up-skirt camera angles and characters with deep cleavage. The game also includes a protracted interaction with a drunken character (e.g., “Wow he smells like he crawled out of the bottle” and “Ahh, the flower of the nightclub! *Hic*”)."

As players progress through the storyline, they are presented with various dialogue and action choices. Some choices can influence other characters to engage in acts of violence (e.g., beating up a bully, shooting a man in self-defense) and/or lead to their deaths (e.g., a character getting shot in the head or stomach, a character committing suicide). Blood is depicted around the corpses and/or when characters are injured. The game also contains implied references to sexual assault and pictures of drugged and bound female characters (fully clothed). Additional sequences contain reference to sexual material: a porn magazine that states “Oregon's Best Boobs;” sexual graffiti on walls (e.g., “69 reasons to b*ng Rachel,\" “Victoria love D”); dialogue such as “Now I can text Warren and tell him he doesn't stand a chance...unless he's into girl-on-girl action.” During the course of the game, a character is shown smoking marijuana; one sequence depicts high-school students intoxicated with alcohol and/or passed out in a party setting.

Players can develop their nation's culture and technology, manage its economic and social infrastructure (e.g., diplomacy, trade) and expand territory through military conquests. Combat with rival nations is presented from a pulled-back, overhead perspective, and military units are represented by small armies of soldiers on a grid map. Battles include animations of swords clashing, gun fights, and vehicular combat that results in icons collapsing, exploding (in the case of vehicles), or disappearing. Historically based text from Civilopedia entries (i.e., reference text) occasionally includes suggestive material (e.g., “From prostitute to pirate lord. . . not the usual career path for a great admiral,” “John didn't think much of Herod's marriage to his half-brother Philip's wife, the adulterous and incestuous Herodias,” and “When Queen Bodica objected, she was flogged and her daughters raped.”).

While much of the battle preparation and fighting takes place on land and sea maps, players can also direct their units into turn-based combat involving cannons, guns, and other explosives. Some of the more intense depictions of violence are contained within cutscene sequences: an army of British soldiers ambushed by French soldiers; the aftermath of soldiers massacred on the battlefield with small pools of blood surrounding their bodies; a man being executed at the chopping block as the camera fades to red. The game also allows players to build up their country's economy, which can include the construction and management of tobacco plantations and wineries.

Combat is turn-based, as players choose when and where to engage in battle, then watch as soldiers inflict damage on each other: gunfire, sword fighting, bayonet slashing/impaling, and artillery fire are all depicted on the battlefield; explosions, battle cries, and frequent sword clashing are heard during battle. Brief cutscenes depict pistol or sword duels between figures, as well as an execution by guillotine—a small splash of dark blood appears on the bottom of the screen after the blade falls.

Combat is frenetic, highlighted by screams of pain, gunfire and/or impact sounds, blood-splatter effects, and slow-motion special moves. Players can perform scripted moves after building up a meter; these actions include breaking necks or limbs and using the environment to cause damage (e.g., slamming heads into a wall, beating an enemy with a nearby bicycle). Cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; a gangster shoving a man's face onto hot coals; a character stabbing himself in the belly. The game includes sexual/suggestive material: a man briefly groping a woman's breasts in a nightclub; online chat rooms in which players' character flirts with webcam girls; characters removing their shirts/tops while in provocative poses (e.g., “Mm, so warm…It feels incredible”; “Ah…You're so big”). One area depicts a character dressed in an outfit with a cutout that exposes his buttocks. During the course of the game, Kazuma can order and drink whiskey at a bar; a status icon denotes character's level of intoxication, while his movement becomes harder to control.

Characters may die of malnutrition or commit suicide if their “sanity” levels fall too low; this is conveyed mostly through text, as inhabitants are simply depicted collapsing and lying on the ground after death. Players can also construct turrets to defend their bases from rival corporations' attacks; missiles and explosions accompany these brief attack sequences. Colonists have a variety of character traits that affect their productivity, including alcoholism; text briefly references alcohol addiction (e.g., “We all find our own ways to cope with this pressure. Tsvetan Hasanov finds it in the bottle.”). The word \"hell\" appears in text."

A handful of sequences depict additional acts of violence and/or gore: a prisoner executed by decapitation; an eviscerated corpse shown at a crime scene. The game depicts some nude female characters with exposed buttocks and breasts. Brief cutscenes also depict characters engaging in sexual activity: a nude woman climbing atop a man; a man in the background briefly thrusting against a woman—sexual moaning sounds can be heard. During the course of the game, players' character can consume alcohol, resulting in drunkenness (e.g., screen-blurring effects, passing out). The words “f**k,” “c*nt,” and “sh*t” are heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "In this cinema-style action game, players control one of four main characters whose lives are altered by events surrounding the investigation of the Origami Killer, a serial killer who kidnaps children in public places. Gameplay consists of controlling a character in a fully interactive environment; choosing a variety of action-, dialogue-, and decision-paths based on on-screen prompts; and watching as cinematic cutscenes progress the somewhat dark (film noir-style) storyline.\r\n\r\nPlayers may encounter victims at various crime scenes: a woman (fully clothed) in a bathtub tainted with blood; a child under forensic examination (though the scene is largely narrative and clinical, with no depiction of victim's face or signs of trauma). More direct depictions of violence include the following: a woman squirming and screaming as she catches on fire; a man impaled in the chest with a power drill; a female attacked in her own home by masked male assailants (the scene is prolonged); and a man shot (shown in slow-motion) by police officers. Blood sometimes accompanies the acts of violence—whether triggered or viewed passively.\r\n\r\nThe most intense instance of violence occurs during a 'lizard trial' sequence in which players' character, Ethan, is forced to cut off a segment of his own finger to save his son's life: Several instruments (saw, scissors, knife, etc.) can be used to remove the finger; and though the camera pans away from the actual dismemberment—instead the blade, the blood, the scream—the scene's poring focus on Ethan's psychological tenor/terror (the dread deliberation before the cut) may be unnerving for some.\r\n\r\nThe game contains sexual content and nudity. Shower cutscenes may depict a male character's bare butt; if players control the female character, her breasts and buttocks are also briefly visible. A more prolonged instance of nudity occurs during a female character's investigation of a seedy club owner: After getting him alone in a room, the player-character is asked to strip; at gunpoint, she dances topless in front of the man. The game also contains a prompt-based love scene (kissing and rubbing) in which players match on-screen cues to angle characters' mouths, remove shirts and blouses, unhook bras, and lower to the floor; a woman briefly appears topless amidst the dark shadows and heavy breathing—actual sex is never depicted as the camera fades to black.\r\n\r\nThe camera does not fade on characters addicted to the fictional drug Triptocaine, referred to as 'dope' in the game: Players may see a character trembling next to open vials; lines of cut white powder on a table; and a man staggering from the drug's ill-effects, as the screen turns blurry. Consumers may also wish to know that the game contains strong profanity (e.g., 'f**k,' 'motherf**ker,' 'sh*t,' and 'a*shole'). Overall, the game's highly evolved motion-capture graphics (advanced renderings by 2010 standards) sharpen the sense of realism, increasing the impact of some aspects of pertinent content (the nudity, blood, violence, etc.)."

Players fight hordes of enemy characters and bosses (e.g., marines, pirates) in melee-style combat. Players punch, kick, use special attacks, and wield stylized/cartoony weapons to defeat enemy forces. Cut scenes occasionally depict characters being struck and killed by swords or gunfire. One attack comically depicts a character emitting flatulence to charge enemies. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters in outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage; dialogue that states, “Do you mind if I take a peek at your panties?” During the course of the game, one character is depicted with a cigar in his mouth. The word “bastard” is heard in the game."

From a third-person perspective, players explore environments, examine crime scenes, and perform tasks while navigating conversations and events with other characters. Some sequences depict characters punching, stabbing, or shooting one another (occasionally seen in slow-motion); characters (including police officers) may also be executed in a handful of scenes. One dramatic sequence involves a man striking a child across the face; players later hear audio of the man beating the child with a belt (the beating is not visually depicted). Homicide scenes sometimes depict human corpses with bloodstained wounds or clothing. The game includes some sexual material and nudity: a sex club containing pole-dancing androids in revealing outfits; a crime scene describing human-android sex (no sexual activity is depicted); an article titled “Android Sex Officially Better!”; posters depicting women in provocative poses barely covering their genitals. During the course of the game, there are several references to a drug called \"Red Ice,\" a fictional version of methamphetamines; one character can be seen smoking the drug from a pipe. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue."

From a 3/4-overhead perspective, players can position characters around a grid-based area to fight enemies in turn-based combat. Players use swords, axes, bows, and magic attacks to defeat enemies. Combat is accompanied by cries of pain and sword-slashing effects.

The game includes text-based sequences involving alcohol;players select various options to advance the narrative (e.g., “Your insistence that the clansmen stay sober does not go over well,” and “It's Rafnsvartr, the unabashed drunk, staggering toward you, looking not entirely sober.”).

Players explore parts of Tokyo and Osaka and engage in missions that often result in fistfights with thugs and/or rival gang members. Characters use knives, pipes, and swords during combat and can trigger scripted special attacks (e.g., bashing heads into walls; stabbing enemies with a knife; ripping off nails and teeth with pliers) after successfully building up an attack meter. Combat is accompanied by screams of pain, large blood-splatter effects, and close-up camera angles. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; characters gunned down inside an elevator; a man executed with a shotgun. The game includes sexual/suggestive material: a sequence in a video parlor in which players hear suggestive moaning sounds and dialogue (e.g., \"You wanna see what I'm hiding under my skirt?\" and \"[Y]ou're giving me some real pervy looks!\"); a mini-game in which players engage in a photoshoot and view videos of real women posing in revealing outfits (e.g., lingerie, swimsuits)—some clips depict camera angles that focus on models' cleavage and buttocks. During the course of the game, Kazuma can order and drink alcoholic beverages at various bars: players are rewarded for drinking in the form of experience points; a status icon denotes character's level of intoxication, while his movement becomes harder to control. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."

A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground.

From a first- and third-person perspective, players traverse an open-world, Wild-West environment; complete mission objectives; interact with characters; and engage in gun fights with lawmen and other outlaws. Players use bows, pistols, shotguns, rifles, and explosives to kill enemies in frenetic combat; shooting enemies occasionally triggers a close-up, slow-motion view of enemies getting shot and killed. Players can also use tomahawks and knives to perform stealth kills to eliminate enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur during battle, and some weapon attacks result in decapitation and/or dismemberment, leaving bloodstains and body parts on the ground. Campsites and cabin environments sometimes depict severed body parts and corpses with exposed viscera. Players may also engage in various criminal activities (e.g., robbing banks, shooting civilians), though this will negatively impact players' progress (e.g., wanted status, pursuit by lawmen and/or bounty hunters). Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a man executed from the gallows; a character shooting himself in the head; a man repeatedly electrocuted; a bound man set on fire. The game contains instances of nudity and brief sexual content: a woman (breasts exposed) straddling a man inside a brothel; a spanking scene that is depicted from a distance and includes a fleeting depiction of male genitalia; sexual moaning sounds inside a tent; male characters with exposed genitalia in non-sexual settings (e.g., a man swimming in a river, corpses on the ground). During the course of the game, players' character can engage in a drinking mini-game in which alcohol is poured for drunken bar patrons; players' character is also depicted drinking alcohol, sometimes resulting in screen-distortion effects and impaired controls. One of the stimulant power-ups is known as Cocaine Gum, which players' character can chew; in one scene, characters can briefly be seen smoking from an opium pipe. The words “f**k,” “n**ger,” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players search for supplies and use machine guns, rifles, and explosives to shoot and kill enemies as the play area constantly shrinks. Frenetic firefights are accompanied by blood-splatter effects, realistic gunfire, and large explosions. Players can also perform various finishing moves on weakened enemies (e.g., stabbing them with a knife; beating opponents down with fists; electrocuting characters). These attacks are often depicted close-up and/or from the victim's perspective."

Players' job is to provide food, shelter, entertainment, and safety for the people, while keeping the government strong—respected by its own citizens and other countries. Respect sometimes comes through the barrel of a gun, and if players have a formidable military presence, they can order their secret police to assassinate a citizen. Players can also quell political uprisings by ordering soldiers to shoot rebels/protestors on the street. Such violence is usually depicted from a zoomed-out, overhead perspective: guards/military will stand about 10 yards away from the citizens and shoot them after players have \"clicked\" though pop-ups or dialogue boxes (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to issue this order?\"; choices: \"OK\" and \"Cancel\"). Players can access several customization menu screens to assign their dictators with specific characteristics, including traits called \"family values,\" \"womanizer,\" and \"alcoholic.\" The womanizer trait includes the description \"You can't sleep with all of them, but you must at least try\"; the alcoholic trait goes into detail about AA meetings, parents who hit the bottle, and the allure of liquor. In one customization menu, a cigar can be selected as a character accessory. Players can also grow tobacco as an export product, open a cigar shop, construct a pub or rum distillery, and monitor drunken teamsters."

Some sequences depict slow-motion pummeling and enemies' deaths, accompanied by large blood-splatter effects. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a captive shot in the head; characters beaten until severely bloody; a man repeatedly shot by a crowd; A handful of missions/environments contain sexual themes and content: a man groping a woman's buttocks; a clerk (Men's Entertainment store) asking, “Are you ready to witness the honkiest hooter experience you've ever had…?”; one mission depicts a man with his buttocks fully exposed. During the course of the game, players' character can enter bars/restaurants and drink alcohol, which is rewarded in the form of experience points; players' character has an alcohol-tolerance gauge, resulting in impaired movement and/or access to drunken attacks. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a half-human, half-god-like Spartan (Kratos) who seeks revenge on the gods of Mount Olympus. Gameplay depicts exaggerated acts of violence and frequent, frenetic killing. Kratos uses double-chained blades to hack-and-slash skeleton soldiers, demonic hounds, centaurs, Cyclops, fire-breathing creatures, and other monsters. Combat is bloody, with large sprays occurring when enemies are struck; blood often stains the ground, surrounding walls, and Kratos' body. The most intense depictions of violence occur during boss battles with the gods. Players engage in close-up and extended battles that are completed by timed button presses according to on-screen prompts. One god is repeatedly thrown into rocks and walls; another's eyes are gouged out by thumbs; another god's head is smashed repeatedly into the ground. One boss has his legs sliced off while another has his head torn off. In some sequences, blood stains the screen after each of Kratos' blows. Most of the gods transform into dust or swarms of insects or cascades of water after “dying.” One sequence contains a sex mini-game: players encounter a goddess and two of her handmaidens, all with bare breasts, holding and caressing each other. If players choose to do so, they may join the goddess in bed; the camera then focuses on the two handmaidens who watch from a distance. As players respond to on-screen prompts, the maidens sometimes caress each other as they continue to watch Kratos and the goddess off-camera. Moaning sounds can be heard throughout the sequence. The game includes some behind-the-scenes footage that contains the word “f**k.”"

    "synopsis": "This is a simulation game in which players design and manage a hospital. Players manage resources, build facilities, hire staff, and diagnose/treat patients. Lack of treatment or proper facilities can sometimes cause patients to urinate, defecate, and/or throw up on the ground; the resultant waste will remain until a janitor cleans it up. Several sequences depict patients using toilets, accompanied by flatulence and flushing sounds. In one sequence, players can shoot at tiny worm-like creatures that \"splat\" when shot, leaving yellow, blood-like stains on the ground."

    "synopsis": "This is a collection of three first-person shooters in which players assume the role of characters uncovering the mysteries behind the dystopian societies of Rapture and Columbia. As players explore each city, they use shotguns, machine guns, rivet guns, and rocket launchers to kill mutated citizens and enemy soldiers. Players can also use special powers (e.g., telekinesis, fire blasts, electric bolts) to kill enemies as well as a three-pronged hook to dismember and decapitate them. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are injured; pools of blood can be seen around corpses. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head at close range; a woman smothered to death with a pillow; a man impaled by a drill; a character nearly lobotomized with surgical tools. The game references sexual material in the dialogue (e.g., “I think yeh gave me the clap, ya dirty boy,” “Gonorrhea! That's what you'll get,” and “Sexual intimacy is no different from any other commodity friend. You sell soybeans I sell companionship.”). During the course of the game, players can consume alcoholic beverages, resulting in a screen-blurring effect; a handful of scenes depict children smoking cigarettes. The social/political backdrop of one fictional city (set in the year 1912) includes the use of derogatory ethnic/racial terms (e.g., the words \"gook,\" \"chink,\" \"negroes,\" \"injuns,\" \"crackers\"); language such as “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “c*nt” can also be heard."

Players use a fitness ring and exercise movements to traverse fantasy environments and battle enemy creatures (e.g., dragons, monster deer, eagles) in turn-based combat. By performing exercise movements (e.g., squats, lunges, knee lifts) players can see such information as heart rate and calories burned, while attacking enemies and draining their life meters. Some players' attacks result in screen-shaking effects; players can also shoot fireballs at rocks and wooden crates from a first-person perspective."

Players defend the U.S. from Russian armed forces, engage in skirmishes and combat missions, and track the ultranationalist to discover clues to his movements, plans, and co-conspirators. Players use machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, and missiles to kill enemy soldiers in frenetic, realistically-depicted combat. Action is highlighted by gunfire, explosions, blood-splatter effects, and cries of pain. The most intense depiction of violence occurs during a “No Russian” mission in which players take on the role of an undercover Ranger: several civilians are gunned down at an airport, and players are given the option to participate in the killings (e.g., players can shoot a wounded civilian crawling away) or to walk through without firing. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the dialogue."

During the course of the game, some female characters perform suggestive taunts and poses, including opening their legs or gyrating their hips. Some of the more provocative outfits are shed during battle, resulting in brief depictions of buttocks and breasts. The camera occasionally pans close-up on breasts as they are jiggling.

Players perform quests, level-up combat skills, and fight enemy clans in turn-based combat. Players select attack moves/spells from a menu before watching characters punch, kick, and throw each other; spells/special moves include blasts of fire and over-the-top assists (e.g., a man attacking with a giant grater). Finishing moves can trigger slow-motion effects and camera zooming that highlight violent acts. Blood effects accompany several moves (e.g., stabbing/slashing). Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a man poking out the eyes of a rival with his thumbs; a character shot in the head; a bound man beaten with pipes and bats—blood effects sometimes embellish these acts. The game contains some sexual material: characters discussing selling porn videos to underage kids; a special move (Extreme Bondage Attack) depicting a woman in lingerie tying up the targeted enemy; characters cleaning up soiled tissues in a brothel (e.g., “Bodily fluids really aren't my thing.”). During the course of the game, players can visit bars to order alcoholic beverages, regaining health during battles (character status is sometimes listed as \"sh*tfaced\"); characters are sometimes seen stumbling and slurring their speech when drunk. The word “f**k” appears in the dialogue."

Players work to find supplies, end civil war, and bring order to the Patriarch of a post-apocalyptic Colorado. From a top-down perspective, players interact with various characters and engage in turn-based battles with enemy factions. Characters use guns, explosives, and melee weapons (e.g., hammers, clubs) to kill enemies. Battles are highlighted by explosions, cries of pain, and large blood-splatter effects. Some cutscenes depict more intense instances of violence: a character's head exploding at close range, with blood splattering the camera; a head falling off a corpse after its body gets jostled; several corpses hanging from nooses; a body dropping from a high platform, resulting in large blood-splatter effects. During the course of the game, players' character can visit a brothel and pay prostitutes for their services. Although no sex acts are depicted, sexual moaning/grunting sounds occur after transactions with prostitutes are made. One male character (fully clothed) is shown performing a masturbatory gesture, while stating “Can't stop…touching myself.” The game contains a handful of drug references (e.g., a drug cartel's processing plant; tables with mounds and lines of white powder); players can obtain and use a variety of drug-like enhancements, which result in prolonged screen-blurring/distortion effects. The words “f**k” and “c*nt” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action adventure game in which players use electrical super powers to subdue urban gangs in a post-apocalyptic world. Presented from a third-person perspective, the game allows players to roam around the \"open world\" environment and electrocute anyone at any time, including civilians and security/police forces. While players receive \"good karma\" points for killing gang members, they are penalized with \"bad karma\" for attacking the pedestrians, objects, and other neutral parties. Combat is often frenetic and includes explosions, cries of pain, and brief blood splashes to indicate damage. Some of the more striking imagery is contained in the comic-book-panel cutscenes: Civilians are seen getting hit by a barrage of machine gun fire; security/prison guards appear gravely injured with patches of blood on their uniforms; silhouettes of impaled corpses hang from large beams. While most of these still images are highly stylized and fleeting, they serve to embellish the dark, apocalyptic tone of the storyline. During the course of the game, a boss character named Sasha appears covered in a tar-like substance, which leaves her cleavage exposed. She sometimes makes suggestive comments during battle (e.g., \"Yes! Yes, I love it!\" and \"We stayed in bed the entire time…\"). Some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t\" and \"b*tch\") can be heard in the dialogue, and a reference to drug dealers is contained in the narration."

From a third-person perspective, players roam around \"open-world\" environments and use element-based projectiles (e.g., lightning bolts, ice spikes, power grenades) to kill mutated monsters, animal-like creatures, and gun-toting soldiers. Combat is often frenetic and includes explosions, cries of pain, and brief blood splashes to indicate damage. Players have the ability to attack pedestrians wandering through the city and Bio Leech them while they are lying on the ground; this electrical attack sucks the life out of the injured character. In one comic book–style cutscene, a character uses a rifle butt to strike a civilian, resulting in a blood-splatter effect. As the game progresses, players can explore a red-light district that contains advertisements infused with sexual references/innuendo (e.g., \"Sex,\" \"Live Nude Girls,\" \"Erotic Peep Show,\" and \"Latch It and Skank\"); some neon signs also depict silhouettes of pole dancers. During the course of the game, players can create their own missions and assign \"drunk\" characteristics (e.g., \"Happy,\" \"Sloppy\") to non-playable characters; in one cutscene, two men are depicted drinking beer until they fall asleep. Another cutscene contains a brief drug reference (e.g., \"What happened, old guy slip you a roofie?\"). The words \"sh*t\" and \"b*tch\" can be heard in the dialogue."

One of the female racers wears a short skirt with a laser gun that clings to her thigh; she taunts opponents by gyrating her hips and blowing a kiss.

Players can explore futuristic locations, interact with citizens, perform missions, and engage in combat to complete various objectives within a storyline. Characters use handguns, machine guns, rifles, and explosives during frenetic firefights with humans and cybernetically enhanced enemies; players can also use melee weapons (e.g., wrist-mounted blades, enhanced limbs) to stab enemies and, in some cases, dismember them. Combat is frenetic, with frequent gunfire, cries of pain, explosions, and blood-splatter effects. Some locations depict mutilated corpses with open chest cavities and/or exposed organs/entrails. During one quest, players assist a character by hammering nails through his hands and feet; screaming sounds and blood effects accompany the scene. The game contains nudity and sexual material: Players can select a gender and customize their character; customization can include depictions of breasts, buttocks, and genitalia, as well as various sizes and combinations of genitals. Players can encounter events where they have the option to engage in sexual activities with other main characters or prostitutes—these brief sex scenes (from a first-person perspective) depict partially nude characters moaning suggestively while moving through various positions. Some scenes contain brief depictions of thrusting motions; other scenes depict a character's head moving towards a partner's crotch. The game contains frequent depictions and references to fictional drugs, including characters taking puffs/hits from a state-altering inhaler/stimulant; an animated billboard ad depicts a man snorting speed. Some sequences allow the player to drink alcoholic beverages repeatedly until the screen distorts; player's character can also drive cars while drunk. The words “f**k” and \"c*nt\" appear in the dialogue."

Players also use swords, axes, arrows, and siege weapons to kill multiple enemies (e.g., soldiers, mythic boss characters) in frenetic melee-style combat. Combat is highlighted by screams of pain and frequent blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to decapitate enemies; zoomed-in sequences depict victims' bones, organs, and muscles getting damaged by players' blade. The game contains some sexual material: a mission taking place in a brothel; topless women straddling men; a character agreeing to “lay with” a man (kissing is depicted before the scene fades to black). A handful of sequences depict screen distortion/discoloration and impaired movements after players' character consumes mushrooms or inhales mushroom-based fumes (dialogue states, “I may still be buzzing from these mushrooms.\"). Players' character can also engage in a drinking contests; later sequences depict the character stumbling as the screen tilts and blurs. The words “f**k” and “c*nt” appear in the dialogue."

From a 3/4–overhead perspective, players control animal- and human-like warriors who use swords, arrows, guns, and magic attacks to kill opponents' minions in melee-style combat. Higher kill counts result in additional achievements (e.g., “leveling up”). Battles are accompanied by slashing sounds, colorful projectiles, and red blood splashes; one vampire warrior's attacks cause larger blood-pooling effects. A variety of female characters are depicted in form-fitting outfits that expose mild cleavage; suggestive jokes can occasionally be heard in the dialogue (e.g., “Sorry boys, I keep the fuzzy cuffs at home,”“Is that a rocket in your pocket?” and “For only $2.95 a minute, I'll leave you breathless.”). One playable character drinks frequently from an oversized cask, slurring phrases such as “The only time I have a drinking problem is when I spill it”; his Drunken Rage ability can be used to reduce inflicted damage. A few sequences also include warriors with lit cigarettes/smoking pipes."

Players can engage in diplomacy, manage resources, and make political decisions that affect their nation's statistics and overall strength. Players can also wage war on other nations; battles are depicted by two soldiers slashing swords or shooting rifles at each other—cries of pain and gunfire/clashing sounds can be heard. The game contains brief references to sexual material (e.g., “Her songs had countless instances of thinly-disguised innuendo and references to unconventional sex acts” and “…personal matters such as sexual intercourse . . .”). One passage references opium (e.g., “[U]nder the influence of an ever worsening and consuming opium addiction.”). The words “bastard” and “damn” appear in text."

The game depicts a 1940s and 50s urban landscape, which includes a criminal underworld that the protagonist must navigate through in order to progress. Players complete various missions that either advance the main storyline or award the player with in-game currency and connections.\r\n\r\nMany of the missions require players to engage in criminal activity: stealing cars, robbing gas stations, running drugs, killing rival gang members. Players use pistols, Tommy guns, shotguns, and knives to kill enemies and occasionally civilians. Blood often spurts out of injured characters, stains the walls/ground, and occasionally sprays onto the screen. Some cutscenes depict more intense instances of violence, including close-range executions, stabbing, and throat slitting. Within the free-roaming context (i.e., not missions), players have the ability to attack police officers and pedestrians on the streets, in bars, shops, etc; however, these acts are not directly rewarded, preventing players from maintaining a low profile from the police.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the game, players can encounter some sexually suggestive material: brothels with prostitutes in revealing lingerie; a gentleman's club with female dancers; and Playboy magazine pin-ups hidden in certain areas of the game (topless images, bare buttocks). There is also a gallery accessible from the main menu, where players can view all of their collected pin ups. One cutscene briefly depicts the top of a woman's head as she performs fellatio on a man—the camera cuts away to other patrons at the table, the man's reactions.\r\n\r\nAlcohol and drug use are also depicted in the game. Players' character can order alcohol at a bar and drink until his vision becomes blurry; players are able to drive their cars in this impaired state. Characters are also depicted buying and selling drugs in a cutscene montage. Although the protagonist is never depicted using drugs, a few ancillary characters sometimes can be seen smoking marijuana or sampling cocaine. Language such as \"f**k,\" \"sh*t,\" and \"\"n**ger\" can be heard in the dialogue."

During some missions, players encounter characters snorting lines of cocaine and/or smoking cannabis joints. Players' character can also engage in a drinking contest, as a means to eliminate a target. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard throughout the game."

Takedowns can cause drivers to be hurled from their vehicles and thrown into the air (i.e., ragdoll physics); human bodies sometimes remain on racetracks and arena floors, as vehicles drive over them. Song lyrics contain brief allusions to drugs (e.g., \"...live high for a while/Indulging in synthetic opulence\"; \"No way out. You're a drug. Someone help.\") and violence (\"Lay a finger on my friend and I'll/make your death look like an accident\")"

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter, based on the novel Metro 2033 , in which players engage in combat amid the shattered subway of a post-apocalyptic Moscow. Players assume the role of a young survivor who traverses the underground tunnels and above-ground remnants, battling humans and mutant creatures along the way. Players use pistols, shotguns, automatic rifles, crossbows, and pipe bombs to kill enemies lurking in the darkness. Melee attacks involve close-up hand-to-hand combat using knives and bayonets. Large plumes of dark blood splash out of humans and mutants when injured; blood may also stain walls, floors, and players' screen (the visor). Characters sometimes use profanity (e.g., \"f**k\" and \"sh*t\") in the dialogue. During the course of the game, players may encounter a prostitute character whose dialogue is sprinkled with sexual innuendo (\"You like what you see?,\" a \"special price,\" and \"I'll show you a good time,\" etc.); though players may follow the woman to her room and exchange currency, the sequence is pre-empted by an in-game event. The game includes a sequence in which players can approach a vendor who states, \"If you're here for the dope, I've got plenty\"; players' character can then inhale from a hookah and experience drug-like effects—blurry vision, losing balance, vomiting."

    "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players assume the role of a samurai (Jin Sakai) on a quest for vengeance against Mongol invaders in 13th century Japan. Players traverse open-world environments, interact with characters, complete quests (e.g., assassination), and infiltrate enemy strongholds. Players use samurai swords, poisoned darts, and bows to battle enemies in melee-style combat. Some attacks result in dismemberment and/or decapitation of enemy soldiers, often accompanied by large blood-splatter effects. Players can also perform assassination kills (e.g., neck stabbing, sword impalement) to dispatch enemies quietly. Cutscenes depict additional acts of intense violence: a soldier lit on fire and beheaded; bound civilians lit on fire and burned at the stake; a decapitated man's head held up towards the screen. The game also depicts a man's exposed buttocks as he bathes in a hot spring. The word \"sh*t\" can be heard in the game. This game contains frequent depictions of extreme violence to human characters. During a number of missions, characters can be seen being decapitated and dismembered. In these instances, strong blood and gore effects are present on impact of the attack. The bodies then slump to the floor and remain there. This game also contains depictions of violence towards defenceless human characters. In these instances, characters are often restrained then beaten/killed. The most pertinent example of this is when an enemy solider is tied to a wooden stake and then burnt to death. He can be seen screaming in pain as his body and clothes catch alight. He then slumps down as his body burns."

    "synopsis": "Infected zombie-like creatures roam the bayous, backwoods, streets, and parishes of a distinctly Southern United States in this first-person shooter set in the aftermath of apocalyptic pandemic. Groups of one-to-four players (i.e., the \"Survivors\") work cooperatively to battle the \"Infected\" zombies and reach safehouses at the end of each round/chapter. Player-Survivors use realistic pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, and assault rifles to kill hordes of zombies throughout the game; chainsaws, machetes, axes, and baseball bats can be used in frenetic close-quarter combat (i.e., melee attacks). In most cases, large sprays of blood shoot out of injured zombies, and they can stain the ground, walls—players' screen; for example, the \"Boomer\"-Infected explode in a shower of blood and bile when shot, which clouds players' view of the impending zombie swarm. Bladed melee weapons and direct hits from rifles, shotguns, etc., cause decapitation or dismemberment; intense depictions include: piles of the Infected in a pool of blood along the roadside; intestines spilling out of abdominal wounds; zombie gibs shooting in all directions; charred innards; and skeletal bits and unclaimed torsos. While the litany of somewhat \"gruesome\" depictions attests to the Mature rating, the over-the-top onslaught is, in some ways, mitigated by the exaggerated menacing evil (camp?) of the drone-like zombie horde; the genre homage (horror, zombies, . . . cricket paddle ) is palpable. Consumers might alsowish to know that the game includes profanity, such as \"sh*t,\"\"a*shole,\" and \"b*tch\"; however, it is the intense violence , the blood and gore that are the primary factors for the Mature rating."

    "synopsis": "This is an action/role-playing game in which players assume the role of Zagreus, the son of Hades, as he attempts to escape the underworld. From a pulled-back ¾ perspective, players battle their way through dungeons filled with mythological enemies (e.g., giant rats, furies, gods). In addition to melee weapons such as swords and hammers, players can acquire magical powers associated with the major Greek gods/goddesses. Combat is frenetic, with frequent explosions, impact sounds, and light effects. Some attacks produce small splatters of blood, and game environments depict blood streaks/stains. The game contains some suggestive material: a character portrait depicting a goddess with long strands of hair covering her breasts and groin; an implied sex scene in which the screen turns black as giggling and whipping sounds are heard. During the course of the game, the god of wine, Dionysus, appears with a chalice of wine; his attack moves contain references to alcohol (e.g., “Drunken Flourish,” “Curse of Nausea,” “Premium Vintage”). The word “bastard” appears in the dialogue."

Players traverse a fantasy world and hunt down and kill various dragons, wyverns, and giant spiders. Players use swords, hammers, bows, and axes to kill creatures in frenetic melee-style combat. Spurts of blood are often depicted when players and creatures are injured during combat. A handful of missions allow players to operate mounted turrets and cannons to shoot rampaging creatures. The game contains several references to alcohol in the dialogue (e.g., “Enjoy the occasional drink and you'll never need a docto—*hic*”; “I had a couple of sips of alcohol…”; “Drinking alone ain't the worst thing, but booze tastes better with company”; “Pops tells the story whenever he gets boozed up.”)."

Players explore a fantasy land, interact with characters, complete missions, and engage in turn-based combat against fantastical creatures (e.g., giant insects, ghosts, evil wizards). Players use swords slashes, axe swings, and magic spells to defeat enemies; battles are accompanied by impact sounds, explosions, and cries of pain. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a man impaled through the chest; a woman thrown off a gorge by a crowd; a character jumping to her death. One sequence depicts a pile of corpses with bloodstains underneath. Some female characters and monsters are depicted with partially exposed breasts or wearing revealing outfits (e.g., deep cleavage). During the course of the game, characters at bars and taverns discuss drinking alcohol, sometimes with slurred speech (e.g., \"I've been drinking the local brew all day! Hic\"; \"The longer you put that drink off, the tastier it becomes\"; \"...buy him a wee dram where he had a bottomless cup\"; \"Hic! That'sh why our drinsh tashte sho good!\")."

    "synopsis": "In this open-world action game, players assume the role of three criminals whose storylines intersect within the fictional city of Los Santos. Players can switch between each character to follow his storyline, completing missions which often include criminal activities (e.g., stealing cars, executing heists, assassinating targets). Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosives to kill various enemies (e.g., rival gang members); players also have the ability to shoot non-adversary civilians, though this may negatively affect players' progress as a penalty system triggers a broad police search. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and the game contains rare depictions of dismemberment. In one sequence, players are directed to use various instruments and means (e.g., pipe wrench, tooth removal, electrocution) to extract information from a character; the sequence is intense and prolonged, and it involves some player interaction (i.e., responding to on-screen prompts). The game includes depictions of sexual material/activity: implied fellatio and masturbation; various sex acts that the player's character procures from a prostitute—while no nudity is depicted in these sequences, various sexual moaning sounds can be heard. Nudity is present, however, primarily in two settings: a topless lap dance in a strip club and a location that includes male cult members with exposed genitalia in a non-sexual context. Within the game, TV programs and radio ads contain instances of mature humor: myriad sex jokes; depictions of raw sewage and feces on a worker's body; a brief instance of necrophilia (no nudity is depicted). Some sequences within the larger game allow players to use narcotics (e.g., smoking from a bong, lighting a marijuana joint); cocaine use is also depicted. Players' character can, at various times, consume alcohol and drive while under the influence. The words “f**k,”“c*nt,” and “n**ger” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of one of two recruits from a special forces unit. From a third-person perspective, players traverse futuristic environments, interact with characters, and battle mutant creatures in melee-style combat. Players use swords and special abilities (e.g., psychokinesis, electric strikes) to kill the mutant creatures and other enemies (e.g., robotic creatures, humans). Battles are accompanied by sword slashes, large explosions, and screams of pain. Players can also perform brief finishing attacks, highlighted by close-up camera angles and slow-motion effects. A handful of cutscenes depict additional acts of violence and blood: a woman holding a bloody knife; a man lying in a pool of blood; characters bleeding after getting shot or attacked. During the course of the game, players can gift alcohol (e.g., Rare Vintage Alcohol, Famous Select Alcohol Set) to various party members; when party members are gifted these items, they are put on display on various tables. The words “a*s” and “bastard” are heard in the game."

Players assume the role of Batman as he fights (never kills) his way through a psychiatric hospital populated by psychopathic criminals and humans infected with a toxic virus. Players can punch, kick, and use weapons (spikes, light beams, and other gadgets) to defend against the onslaught of enemies. Some attacks are highlighted by special effects, such as slow-motion hits and close-ups of damage inflicted. During the course of the game, players can enter rooms with blood stains on the ground and walls or witness the \"infected\" twitching and screaming in pain. Some inmates and guards are strewn unconscious/dead on the asylum floors, while others are tied-up, strapped to torture devices, or are being tortured (e.g., a guard suffering in an electric chair). Two female characters wear provocative outfits that expose deep cleavage and/or partial buttocks, and one of them moans suggestively when she is in peril. Players are occasionally required to identify and track traces of whiskey/tobacco during missions. Some expletives (e.g., \"b*tch,\"\"damn,\" and \"pissed\") can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "Saints Row 2 is an 'open-world' action game in which players assume the role of gang members set on re-establishing their former glory in the fictionalized urban setting of Stilwater. Missions primarily involve destroying rival gangs and their members by any means necessary: Players can attack and kill characters using pistols, chainsaws, baseball bats, knives, flamethrowers, and night sticks. Players can also roam 'off-mission' and kill non-adversaries (e.g., pedestrians, shop-keepers, homeless people, etc.) at any time. Collateral damage includes spurts of blood when characters are shot, stabbed, or bludgeoned and extensive post-mortem violence (e.g., players can keep shooting at dead bodies, causing them to flail and emit more blood; players can earn 'respect points' for taunting dead human corpses). One cutscene depicts a character holding a decapitated head over a railing. The game features cutscenes and missions that contain depictions of sexual behavior: One cutscene depicts a woman's head moving out of screen and into a gang member's lap – suggesting fellatio; Intercourse is implied as players drive around a prostitute who \"performs\" with a client in the back seat. Certain missions involve drugs – delivering, selling or arranging transactions –, while players can also purchase marijuana blunts, which can impair the player's vision through a 'screen-blur' effect. Players can also hear strong profanity throughout the game (e.g. \"f*ck,\"\"sh*t,\"\"c*nt,\" etc.)."

As players explore various planets, they use futuristic weapons (e.g., laser rifles, Cryo-beams, shotguns) and special abilities (e.g., concussive blasts, telekinetic pushes) to combat hostile alien races. Battles are frenetic, highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, and screams of pain; enemies sometimes emit splashes of blood when hit. During the course of the game, the central character can develop relationships with crew members and engage in brief sexual encounters with them. These brief sequences (couplings) depict sensual caresses, sexual moaning, and hip gyrations; characters' breasts and/or buttocks are sometimes exposed for prolonged periods. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue. Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB."

    "synopsis": "In this first-person shooter, players assume the role of Subject Delta, a genetically enhanced human (a \"Big Daddy\") who roams the underwater city of Rapture to protect a breed of \"Little Sisters.\" Players' objective is to escape the city and thwart the plans of a villain who controls Rapture's citizens, who is creating large numbers of Little Sisters. As players explore Rapture's dark and dangerous wasteland, they will encounter its hostile mutated citizens, who attack and attempt to kill Delta on sight. Players use rivet guns, giant drills, and firearms (spear rockets, Gatling guns, shotguns, etc.) to defend themselves against the horde of frenzied humanoids. Special powers such as telekinesis, electricity, and fire/freezing can also be used to kill the attacking populace. Intense acts of violence are as follows: players can use telekinesis to bring enemies close-up before drilling them to death—blood splatters in all directions; players can freeze enemies and allow them to shatter into pieces; players can set fire to enemies, or electrocute them in standing pools of water. In addition to the spurts of blood from combat, players will sometimes encounter smears of blood on walls and floors, and corpses lying in pools of blood—or spiked onto walls with rivets. When players come across a \"special\" corpse, they may set down the Little Sister and allow her to harvest ADAM (a DNA-modifying substance); the depiction of a child-like creature using a needle to draw fluid from a corpse can be somewhat unsettling (though overtly fantastical). Consumers may wish to know that the game contains minor sexual content. While exploring Rapture's Red Light District, players can overhear conversations alluding to prostitution (e.g., \"Hello there, how much? . . . Twenty bills and I'm all yours, sailor.\"); players may also see a variety of ads and signs for strip clubs (e.g., \"Eve's Garden XXX\")—these brief scenarios contribute to the Sexual Themes descriptor (i.e., the violence and profanity account for the Mature rating). The game includes frequent use of strong profanity (e.g., \"f**k,\" \"motherf**ker,\" and \"c*nt\") and some lesser four-letter words (e.g., \"sh*t\" and \"tw*t\"); in one instance, an enemy attacks Delta while screaming, \"F**king sodomites everywhere!\" [italics added]"

    "synopsis": "Players \"relive\" the life of an assassin during the Italian Renaissance in this open-world action adventure game. The goal is to exact revenge upon conspirators who have framed and executed loved ones; the goal is to be accomplished through assassination. As players roam the crowded streets of Florence, Italy, they can creep through catacombs and corridors, undertake diverse side-missions, and tail-and-assassinate all manner of human targets—politicians, Templar soldiers, conspirators. Players can also brawl with family rivals or engage in sword fights with Templar soldiers, but in most cases, they use stealth techniques to complete the mission; for example, players can sneak up on enemies from behind and kill them with hidden daggers, poisoned daggers, spring-activated blades, and swords. When blades connect, blood shoots out in a fountain-like manner as targets groan or scream. These stealth-kills are sometimes depicted close-up and are somewhat graphic: the camera follows the \"herky-jerky\" thrusts of the blade; the player hears a distinctly \"wet\" flesh-impact sound. The most graphic depictions of violence occur during cinematic cutscenes (the following two scenes do not involve players' character): A businessman, crawling away from a Templar leader, gets pinned to the ground by a sword through his neck; a young nobleman is ambushed by rivals, begs for mercy, then gets stabbed multiple times in the chest amid screams of \"Muori! Mouri! Mouri!\" [Die! Die! Die!]. The spurts and sprays of blood that accompany some of the stabbing attacks can be intense. The game contains strong sexual overtones. During one \"seduction mini-game,\" players are able to press buttons to kiss a woman and remove her dress; with the woman's back facing the camera, the two characters lower to bed and blow out a candle. Some scenes take place inside brothels, though no nudity or sexual acts are depicted. The dialogue contains the following sexual references: \"So the whip or the paddle today?\" and \"Does your wife know about your page-boy fantasies, Captain?\" Character backstories, narrated through still-frame vignettes, explain how villains and historical figures achieved their notoriety; some biographies include references to adultery, sodomy, prostitution, and rape (e.g., \"Caterina was captured and sent to Rodrigo Borgia . . . who kept her imprisoned for a year and is rumored to have raped her alongside his son.\"). One cutscene depicts a man and a woman wearing translucent, flesh-toned bodysuits as they flee from danger. The digitized lighting effects, the glow from their futuristic suits, obscure most of the details, though outlines of breasts and buttocks are partially discernable (i.e., not definitively nudity). Consumers may also wish to know that the game contains strong profanity, both in English and Italian (e.g., \"f**k,\"\"sh*t,\" c*zzo,\" and \"m*rda\"); the most explicit instance occurs when a man frantically describes a \"vision\"—\"I'm at the opera . . . the soprano is so beautiful . . . I'm in bed with her, she cries as I f**k her.\""

    "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control a group of mythical warriors through missions and battles in the ravaged lands of Ferelden. The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person role-playing games where the user does not usually have direct control over combat moves. Instead, players select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, dragon, bear, etc.) and an action (e.g., \"attack,\"\"kill,\" and magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage by emitting splashes of red blood; pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. The most intense instances of violence occur when players have the option to kill non-combatant civilians: A prisoner can be stabbed to death in order to steal a key; a merchant who overcharges refugees can be slashed in the throat; and a boy possessed by an evil demon can be killed off-screen. During the course of the game, players are able to visit a brothel where a hostess asks what they are interested in. If players select \"Surprise me,\" they can sometimes wind up face-to-face with a woman, a man, a transsexual, or an animal; sexual activity is never depicted during these brothel encounters. Players can also initiate brief cutscene sequences in which couples (male and female or same sex couples) can be depicted kissing, embracing, and caressing one another as the screen fades to black. Though the game never features human nudity, one female demon character is briefly depicted with bare breasts. Some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t,\"\"b*tch,\" and \"a*s\") can be heard in the dialogue."

Players travel across various lands, interact with characters, and engage in battle against humans and fantasy creatures (e.g., hyena-/jackal-like animals, demons, skeletons). Players use swords, spears, and magic spells to kill several opponents. Combat can be frenetic at times, accompanied by clashing sounds and brief yells. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence: an extended off-screen sequence in which a character is stabbed; a man shot off-screen while crawling away. Dark blood stains appear on the floors of one level. The game includes some suggestive/sexual material: female characters dressed in revealing outfits; camera angles that pan suggestively on bodies; women offering companionship to men in a coastal city; dialogue that states “[s]tay clear from them two. Gave me the crotch rot, they did!” Players occasionally encounter characters who consume alcohol (e.g., “Jussone more cup, littlemann! Hic!”). The word “sh*te” appears in dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Desmond, an assassin who must revisit the lives of his ancestors during the American Revolutionary War. Most missions require players to find, stalk, and kill enemies with a variety of weapons (e.g., muskets, handguns, bayonets, tomahawks). Players can also engage in swordfights with armed soldiers, resulting in depictions of impaled characters and occasional slow-motion effects; large blood splashes appear when enemies are injured. Cinematic cutscenes depict additional blood splatter on characters' bodies and/or clothing, along with more intense acts of violence: an unarmed prisoner getting his throat slit; a man getting shot in the head at close range; a man getting bludgeoned in the head with a cleaver. The dialogue contains a variety of sexual material/innuendo: “King Louis filled the place with whores to keep his men from turning tail,”“[H]ere you are banging my sister behind my back,”“Don't flog the bishop again, lads,”“[T]hey spend 20 minutes simulating . . . sex and walk off with millions.” The game also contains the words “f**k” and “sh*t.” (spoken in both English and French)."

    "synopsis": "In this massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game, based on the Star Wars universe, players engage in a fictional conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Players can choose from classic Star Wars roles (e.g., Jedi Knight, Bounty Hunter, Trooper) and complete quests to determine their path down the light or dark side of the Force. Players use light sabers, laser blasters, and telekinetic powers to battle a variety of human-like enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., aliens, cyborgs); battles frequently depict characters getting shot with lasers, slashed with light sabers, or shocked with lightning bolts. During the course of the game, players are presented with interactive cutscenes in which their choices play a vital role in the outcome of their story (e.g., using electrical attacks on restrained characters to collect information; killing someone instead of letting him go). Some sequences depict brief instances of blood and gore: to complete one quest, players must dip a skull in a pool of blood; in another mission, players deliver a severed head to a specific location and place it on a pike. Players can freely explore many areas in the game, including clubs that depict scantily clad female dancers with exposed cleavage; some sequences include dialogue with sexual innuendo (e.g., “An hour. I think I'm insulted. We'll need the whole night,” “I'll be sure to make conjugal visits,” and “Come, dear, let's forgo the nuptials and proceed to the honeymoon.”). The words “damn” and “hell” can be heard in dialogue throughout the game. Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB (Windows PC)"

Some side-scrolling games allow players to punch, kick, and use various weapons (e.g., swords, drills, and mallets) to defeat enemy creatures and villains; blood-like splashes appear as enemies are injured. In one third-person shooter, players use pistols and machine guns to kill “cartoony” enemy bears. Some sequences in the third-person shooter depict characters getting shot and dismembered; large blood-splatter effects occur, and blood frequently stains the ground. One game contains instances of mature humor/sexual material: a “cartoony” pile of singing feces; sexual moaning sounds; allusions to fellatio/sex between a male and female cog (e.g., “Oh no! Not Mr. Big Cog! That's me buggered!”). During the course of the game, some characters are depicted drinking beer, which triggers a screen-blurring effect; one character smokes a cigar for a prolonged period. The words “sh*t,” “tw*t,” and “as*hole” are heard in the game."

From a first-person perspective, players explore environments and use pistols, shotguns, and machine guns to shoot and kill fantastical creatures (e.g., werewolves, ghouls, mutants, mechanical humanoids) found throughout the surrounding areas. Some attacks result in decapitation and/or dismemberment of enemies, often accompanied by large splatters of blood; some areas depict large bloodstains and entrails within the environment. Cutscenes can depict additional acts of intense violence and gore: a character's heart ripped out of their chest; a person chopped through the shoulder by a machete; a character impaled through the chest by a giant weapon; a person repeatedly shot. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game."

    "synopsis": "In this \"open-world\" action game, players assume the role of Kazuma, a manager of an orphanage in Okinawa, a man whose peaceful life gets interrupted by his criminal past. Players are drawn back to the Yakuza underworld—Japanese gangsters and shady dealings—as they follow storylines that take them through missions and Tokyo streets. The game's main combat involves barehanded street fighting: Battles against thugs and gangsters are common, and necessary to progress through the game. Players punch, kick, grapple, and use weapons (bats, pipes, two-by-fours, etc.) to beat up human enemies. And after building up a secondary energy meter, players can execute more intense hits—slamming opponents' heads into walls, head-butting them, throwing characters to the ground. Often, quick splashes of blood trail the hits. Cutscenes also depict blood, but more often, characters getting betrayed, shot, threatened, hit in the back with a sledgehammer, stabbed in the hand with a butter knife (the screaming in the last-mentioned scene is somewhat unsettling). During the course of the game, players are able to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. The list of drinks on the scrolling menu screen is extensive; and players' character gets intoxicated if he drinks too much (e.g., a glowing bottle icon appears on screen). The game is designed such that when drunk, players are more likely to get into fights: bystanders, gang members, street thugs—they get more agitated than usual, a little less tolerant of drunken displays (e.g., \"You reek of alcohol, pops\" and \"Your stench is making everyone else want to puke!\"); metal chairs and two-by-fours settle most differences, though conciliation soon follows (e.g., \"Sh*t, I can't even beat up a drunk\" and \"I'm sorry to have started a fight with you . . . Please, take this\" [3000 Yen]). One cinematic cutscene takes place in a nightclub, where bikini-clad women dance provocatively on poles—spreading their legs, bending over, gyrating; the camera tends to capture the low angles, and it pans and zooms-in liberally. The game also contains its share of strong profanity (\"f**k,\"\"mother**ker,\"\"sh*t,\" and \"a*shole\"); for example, \"Why don't I just kill the sorry f**k and become the next chairman?\""

Players engage in turn-based combat by moving around a grid and selecting attacks from a menu. Players use various weapons (e.g., blades, claws), blasts of energy/ice/lightning, and melee attacks during combat. Blood-splatter effects occur often, and cutscenes occasionally depict “cartoony” dismemberment or decapitation. The game includes several instances of mature humor, racial humor, and sexual material: characters are depicted urinating and defecating; one extended sequence (in a strip club) depicts a character performing a lap dance while emitting flatulence; one scene depicts a towel character performing an obscured sex act on a man in an alley; another scene shows a man watching security monitors and repeatedly reaching for lubrication behind his desk—all sequences are depicted in a cartoony and over-the-top manner. Characters are sometimes depicted nude (e.g., breasts, buttocks, male genitalia). During the course of the game, players can observe characters snorting lines of cocaine, and in one level, players must complete a quest to bring a marijuana prescription to a character. The words “f**k,” \"c*nt,\" and “sh*t,” and racial epithets (e.g., \"n**ga,\" \"sp*ok\") are heard in the dialogue. Platform: Windows PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One"

    "synopsis": "Fallout 3 is a action role-playing game set in the barren wasteland of a post-apocalyptic society. Players assume the role of a resident of an underground complex who emerges from a vault to explore a wastleland universe through a series of quests/missions. Mission objectives sometimes involve exploring various caves, sewers, and subway tunnels, while other quests involve combat with human and mutant survivors. Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of realistic dismemberment with trails of red blood. In one scene, players enter a black-and-white virtual reality simulation in which they use a kitchen knife to kill household members and pets. Characters are sometimes seen consuming fictional drugs (e.g., \"Buffout,\" \"Jet,\" and \"Mentats\"), while the player can also use – with no visual depiction of consuming/administering – a narcotic called \"psycho,\" which with repeated uses leads to addiction. A screen-blurring effect indicates the state of characters' intoxication and the need to use the narcotic to fend off various side effects. Several of the characters are prostitutes and the details of their sexual activities are mildly insinuated (e.g., \"You got the cash I got the time…I take care of men around here.\"). Strong profanity can also be heard throughout the game (e.g., \"f*ck,\" \"a*shole,\" and \"sh*t\")."

Battles are depicted mostly from a third-person perspective as players perform various actions such as firing weapons (guns, grenades, cannons, flamethrowers), using healing items, claiming flag points, and moving tanks along city streets. Several interspersed cutscenes depict characters being shot and killed and sometimes include small splashes of pixilated red blood. One sequence involves female characters wearing and discussing \"racy\" bathing suits, while the camera pans and lingers on certain body parts. A handful of cutscenes depict a character smoking a cigarette."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of a bank robber for hire who takes on various heists/jobs. Players traverse a modern city and earn skill points and experience on their way to becoming elite criminals. Players use pistols, machine guns, and sniper rifles to shoot and kill various human characters; some of these characters include police and SWAT team members. Players have the ability to shoot random civilians, but there is a penalty for doing so. Violence is highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and large blood-splatter effects. During the course of the game, some paintings and drawings depict women in suggestive poses and/or revealing outfits. Some missions require interaction with drugs: in one mission, players cook and defend batches of methamphetamine (“meth”); another mission requires players to guard and transport large bags of cocaine. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players move to the country after inheriting a farm. Players interact with townspeople, raise livestock, and earn money by performing quests and selling their goods. Some quests require players to explore caves and battle \"cartoony\" enemies (e.g., jelly creatures, crabs, flying monsters). From a top-down perspective, players use swords to briefly strike creatures and deplete their health meters. A handful of creatures emit small splashes of blood when defeated. One area contains a casino in which players can wager coins on slot machines and blackjack-style card games. During the course of the game, characters are occasionally depicted smoking pipes or cigarettes; players can also drink mugs of beer, sometimes resulting in a temporary “tipsy” status effect. The word “damn” appears in the dialogue."

Several of the pinball tables depict animated female characters kneeling on their hands and knees, dressed in revealing animal-themed clothing. If players earn enough points, they are able to trigger Sexy Challenges that allow them to bounce pinballs off characters' breasts or buttocks; when these challenges are completed successfully, the characters' clothes vanish, leaving them partially nude with their hands covering their breasts/genitalia. In one game mode, players can repeatedly grab/squeeze a character's body while she moans suggestively. The word “sh*t” appears in the dialogue."

From a third-person perspective, players use swords, mirrors, and magic attacks (e.g., brush strokes generating bursts of fire, wind, ice, thunder, water) to defeat human-like enemies (youkai) in melee-style combat. Enemies generally burst into clouds when defeated; some enemies split in half, emitting stylized spurts of blood. A handful of still images depict animals surrounded by large red bloodstains. One sequence depicts a character using a sword to decapitate the heads of a hydra-like monster. The game includes some suggestive material: a woman whose kimono reveals large portions of her buttocks; a sequence in which a bug pops out of a woman's cleavage; a cutscene in which characters observe a woman bathing in a stream; dialogue that states, \"Now you just hold your melons, babe!\" A few cutscenes depict characters drinking from jugs of sake or smoking pipes; Amaterasu can also obtain a variety of sake power-up items. One level contains a dog enemy that uses feces or urine to attack opponents."

Players use a retractable laser beam katana to slash, chop, impale, and dismember enemies in frenetic melee-style combat. Battles are highlighted by screams of pain and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks result in intense depictions of violence: enemies sliced in half as blood gushes from wounds; characters beheaded as blood shoots from necks in exaggerated spurts. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence: an assassin committing suicide by placing a grenade in her mouth; a woman getting sliced into several pieces in slow motion; a character bashing several characters in the head with a baseball bat. The game contains references to sexual material: adult videos with titles such as, \"How to Please a Woman in Bed 101 Part 2\"; “The Best of Raunchy Amateur Interviews 2”; and “Air Force One: The First Lady Returns to the Mile High Club”; t-shirts with the word “Love T*ts” printed backwards. The words \"f**k\" and \"sh*t\" can be heard in the dialogue."

The game is rendered in black and white and the graphics are presented in a 2D side-view silhouette. Enemies throw fireballs, shoot arrows, or try to lure the boy into traps; traps and hazards contain giant boulders, saw blades, electric wires, spikes, and snapping bear traps. When killed, the boy gets flung around environments, impaled on spikes, or sliced into pieces. Black-and-white blood splashes accompany most attacks and death animations."

The lead up to the deaths is portrayed only through audio and subtitles. When the death occurs, the scene becomes a still 3D image which you can freely explore and view from multiple angles. Some of the deaths are particularly gruesome, such as a man being ripped in half by a kraken, and a group of men whose necks are being crushed by the claws of a large crustacean. While these images are particularly gruesome, the fact that they are still images, paired with such a highly artistic style lessens the impact of the violence. The audio can be highly disturbing with the sounds of characters screaming in pain and bones breaking."

As soon as a character's health bar has expired it transforms into glowing ash and disappears. One on one combat has the same type of violence.

    "synopsis": "Rating Summary This is an action game in which players assume the role of Joel and Ellie, human survivors battling their way through a post-apocalyptic world. From a third-person perspective, players traverse through city ruins and use a variety of weapons (e.g., pistols, rifles, explosives, spiked bats, steel pipes, and blades) and melee attacks to fight off infected mutants and other human survivors. Players can also employ stealth kills (e.g., strangulations, pistol executions, stabbing attacks) and engage in extended combat sequences involving close-up camera angles and on-screen prompts. Screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and blood-splatter effects accompany the combat. Several attacks result in decapitations and dismemberment; body parts are depicted in some areas (e.g., chopping blocks). Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a young character dying in a man's arms from gunshot wounds; adult characters being executed at point-blank range; an enemy getting interrogated and stabbed in the knee. During the course of the game, a character makes sexual remarks about an adult magazine (e.g., \"Whoa. How the hell would he even walk around with that thing\" and \"Oh why are these [pages] all stuck together\"). One scene allows player to decide whether a young character drinks alcohol. The words \"f**k,\" \"sh*t,\" and \"a*shole\" can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is 2D turn-based strategy game in which players control worms in a battle to be the last man (worm) standing. Players take turns positioning their worms around fantastical landscapes and use a variety of over-the-top weapons (\"cartoony\" bazookas, dynamite, exploding sheep, a Concrete Donkey, etc.) to defeat opponents' worms. Explosions and gunfire can be heard frequently, as well as rapid-fire expletives uttered during the heat of battle (e.g., \"a*s,\" \"damn\" and \"hell\"). Worms often make irreverent comments that can sometimes be suggestive (e.g., \"Stop it. I'm wounded yet aroused\" and \"Umph, kinda sensual\")."

    "synopsis": "Advice for consumers This game has received a PEGI 18 which restricts availability to ADULTS ONLY and is not suitable for anyone below this age. This rating has been given due to depictions of strong violence, use of strong language and depictions of sex with visible genitals. Not suitable for persons under 18 years of age. Brief outline of the game Open-world action-adventure story set in Night City, a megalopolis obsessed with power, glamour and body modification. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw seeking a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality. Explore a vast city where the choices you make shape the story and the world around you. Content specific issues This game contains frequent depictions of strong violence towards human-like characters. Powerful attacks with both bladed weapons and firearms can cause dismemberment and decapitation, accompanied by strong blood and gore effects. Wounds and other injuries are very detailed and bodies can be mutilated further after being killed. There is a side mission in which a man chooses to be killed by crucifixion, recreating the death of Jesus Christ. The player is able to hammer in the nails and then raise the cross. The man can be heard screaming in pain and continues to struggle until he dies. The game also contains frequent use of strong language ('cunt' and 'fuck'). The player's character has the ability to 'romance' various characters. Some of these 'romance' options lead to depictions of sexual activity, shown from a first person perspective. In some cases, genitals are visible after sex has taken place."

    "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players assume the role of Dante, a demon slayer fixated on avenging the destruction of his family. Players use melee weapons (swords, scythes) and firearms to attack demon hordes in frenetic melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, explosions, and slow-motion effects; large blood splashes occur often as enemies are dismembered and/or killed. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a giant boss creature chopped to pieces by fan blades; a character getting shot through the stomach; Dante holding up a monster's severed head; a dramatic impaling. Some scenes also depict sexual activity: scantily clad strippers dancing/gyrating provocatively with each other; a woman moving her head toward Dante's lap (fellatio is implied). During one cutscene, moaning sounds can be heard while a female character is bent over a table—a man is positioned behind her, though there is no actual depiction of the sex act. A handful of still images (i.e., concept art) portray women with exposed breasts and/or buttocks. The phrase “crack whore” and words such as “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “c*nt” can be heard in the dialogue."
