    "synopsis": "This is a strategy game in which players must save present-day Earth from an alien invasion. As players manage resources, research weapon technology, and monitor alien presence, they can dispatch squads of soldiers to attack human- and insect-like creatures in turn-based combat. From a 3/4-top-down perspective, players use assault rifles, grenades, and other military-grade weapons to kill nearby enemies. Battles are accompanied by intermittent cutscenes that depict close-up (e.g., over-the-shoulder) instances of violence: soldiers getting impaled or beaten to death by alien creatures; realistic explosions that result in larger blood sprays. If an alien “implants” an egg into a dead human, the character will eventually explode amid additional gibbing effects. Some scenes depict dead or dying soldiers whose bodies are burned or mutilated. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players assume the role of Corvo, a royal bodyguard who has been framed for treason (i.e., assassinating an empress). As players help Corvo exact revenge on those who betrayed him, they can use pistols, crossbows, swords, and grenades to kill human enemies in ranged and melee-style combat. Violence is sometimes accompanied by slow-motion effects and gurgling sounds from Corvo's victims. Certain weapons result in dismembered limbs, and attacks are accompanied by exaggerated blood-splatter effects. Some environments depict mutilated corpses on the ground or hanging from the ceiling. During one interactive sequence, Corvo brands a restrained man's cheek with a hot iron; in another, players use electric shocks to interrogate a blindfolded man in a chair. The game depicts some female characters in revealing outfits and includes some sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., “Hey sweetheart, you want to play with me? You're a lot cuter than my regulars,”“This one thinks only of whores,” and “Sell your wife into prostitution, I'm sure I can get you a good price.”). The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can also be heard in the game."

As Lara, players explore caves and ruins, and use arrows, firearms (e.g., pistols, shotguns, machine guns), and bladed weapons to battle wild animals, human enemies, and demonic soldiers. During several sequences, Lara is depicted getting stabbed, beaten, strangled, or shot by enemies; these close-up deaths occur as fail scenarios, usually when players miss certain action cues. A handful of cutscenes also depict enemy characters shot at close range. Large blood-splatter effects occur when characters are hit; one level depicts a demonic lair covered in dismembered human corpses--scattered limbs and pools of blood are prominent. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

As players explore open-world environments, they complete missions to gain experience and increase their characters' skills/abilities. Players use machine guns, sniper rifles, flamethrowers, explosives, and weaponized vehicles to kill human-like characters and hostile aliens in frequent combat. Firefights contain realistic gunfire/explosions; injured enemies scream and emit exaggerated splashes of blood. Various weapons result in dismembered limbs or bloody gibs. Some missions depict intense acts of violence: viewing characters getting electrocuted; shooting a man in the face; killing players' incinerating a cult member as part of a ritual sacrifice. The dialogue contains jokes/one-liners that reference sexual material (e.g., “I will hang myself from my own tombstone if in you I can't put my bone,”“If there's anything they love more than getting to second base with their sisters, it's cars,”“Bacon is for sycophants and products of incest.”); during some sequences, players can find and collect adult-themed magazines—though no actual nudity is depicted. One mission requires players to consume three alcoholic beverages from a bar before they can progress. The words “sh*t,”“p*ssies,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue, in addition to language censored by audible bleeps (e.g., “God-[bleep]-ing-dammit”)."

Players use pistols, scoped rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, and futuristic weaponry to kill enemies in ranged combat; battles are highlighted by cries of pain, realistic gunfire, and large explosions. Stealth moves (i.e., “assassinations”) can also be used to attack enemies from behind (e.g., snapping their necks or stabbing/impaling them with bladed weapons). During one cutscene, a human character cries out as her body disintegrates, exposing layers of muscle tissue. Large blood-splatter effects occur when humans are shot; some sequences depict bloodstained environments."

    "synopsis": "In this third-person shooter, players assume the role of Max Payne, an NYPD detective-turned-bodyguard for a wealthy Brazilian family. As the noir–style storyline unfolds, players use machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and explosives to kill human adversaries (e.g., armed thugs, gang members, paramilitary units) in frenetic combat. Slow-motion effects (i.e., “bullet time”) can be utilized for improved targeting precision, and killing certain enemies triggers a zoomed-in “bullet cam” (close-ups of entry/exit wounds/headshots). Frantic screaming and realistic gunfire occur throughout, and characters emit large blood-splatter effects when hit; some explosions (in gameplay and cutscenes) result in dismembered limbs or bloodstained surroundings. Non-adversaries—if unrelated to the storyline—can be killed without consequence, and dead bodies may incur additional damage. A variety of cutscenes (some interactive) include more intense acts of violence: a hostage getting shot at point-blank range; a man getting doused with gasoline and set on fire; an injured, bleeding enemy crying out during an interrogation. During the course of the game, Max visits a strip club that depicts topless pole dancers. As he enters the club, fleeting sexual activity can be observed in the background: a partially nude prostitute sitting on top of a man; a character thrusting against a woman, whose body is partially obscured by two onlookers. The game sometimes references or portrays illegal substances (e.g., a “drug den” with bags of white powder scattered across a counter); in a couple of sequences, characters are depicted snorting cocaine. Alcoholism is a significant component of Max's character, and several cutscenes portray him drinking heavily and/or stumbling amid blurred screen effects. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,”“c*cksucker,”“c*nt,”“sp*c,” and “n*gga” can be heard in the dialogue."

As players interact with myriad characters (e.g., developing alliances and relationships), they use machine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, and futuristic weapons to kill humans and alien creatures in frenetic combat. Enemies sometimes emit splashes of blood when hit; some sequences depict bloodstained characters or environments. Cutscenes depict other instances of violence: an alien shooting herself in the head with a pistol; a character getting impaled by a creature's claws. As the game progresses, the storyline sometimes references sexual material (e.g., “When this is over, I'm getting laid” and “Were oil and lubricants involved? Was there moaning?”). Players can also initiate brief romantic encounters between characters: dialogue choices are made, leading to kissing and caressing on a bed—sexual activity is implied. In one of these sequences, an alien character's buttocks and breasts are briefly depicted. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in dialogue."

Some courses contain wide gaps, explosives, and other hazardous obstacles that can propel riders off their bikes. Players often get knocked forcefully to the ground or flail in the air (i.e., ragdoll physics) before landing. Groans and bone-cracking sounds can often be heard, and brief splotches of blood are occasionally depicted when riders hit the ground. While the majority of the game focuses on completing the obstacle course with as few faults as possible, a \"Crash\" mode awards players for breaking multiple bones."

Stealth is a primary game mechanic, and players can execute various attack moves to avoid detection (e.g., descending from above to slice enemies' throats). Though combat and cutscenes are stylized and cartoonlike, kills are accompanied by exaggerated splashes of bright red blood. Cut scenes also depict acts of violence: a guard getting chopped in half; a villain impaling himself with a sword as blood pools underneath him. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue."

Players use machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and explosives to complete mission objectives and kill human adversaries. Players can also employ stealth tactics (e.g., poisoning a character's food/drink; slitting their throats from behind; strangling them with fiber wire) to eliminate adversaries at close range. Violent encounters are accompanied by realistic gunfire/explosions, large blood-splatter effects, and characters pleading for their lives; dead bodies incur additional damage when shot. Non-adversaries can be injured/killed at will (this may negatively affect players' score), and some sequences allow players to kill police officers. Some sequences reference sexuality/prostitution (e.g., “This little bad boy can transform even the most ardent Buddhist monk into a sex-craving lunatic,”“Rumor has it she killed a John trying to rape her,”“The press published photographs of one of his orgies . . .”). Some party scenes feature women in skimpy lingerie (e.g., string bikinis, thin strips of cloth), and other missions portray women performing lap dances while men caress their chest and buttocks. In a couple of sequences, characters can be observed snorting cocaine off nearby tables. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

Various gauntlet and acrobatic maneuvers can be combined to form strings of different attacks as players get knocked and thrown around – but never die – during battle. Story elements are told through cutscenes that contain mild profanity (e.g., 'a*s'), references to alcohol products such as wine, and mildly suggestive dialogue (e.g., 'I'll go first, but, hey, no staring at my a*s. I've felt you looking' and 'Nice carving I prefer a nice nymph or a succubus myself…')."

Players compete in a series of combative rounds in order to advance to different matches throughout the game. Players use swords, guns, chains, spikes, and supernatural attacks (e.g., fire, ice, lightning) to defeat a cast of human-like characters.

Many of these finishing moves depict over-the-top instances of violence: impalement, bone-crushing body snaps, execution-style gunshots to the head; large blood-splatter effects occur during these sequences, staining characters' bodies and the ground. Several of these exaggerated finishing moves depict characters getting dismembered, ripped or sliced in half, stabbed, set on fire, or set to explode. During the course of the game, female characters sometimes wear revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; one female fighter is depicted partially nude, covered by a costume of thin cloth strips.

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the roles of members of an elite squadron on the trail of a Russian ultranationalist. Players defend the U.S. from Russian armed forces, engage in skirmishes and combat missions, and track the ultranationalist in an attempt to discover his true motivations and co-conspirators. Players use machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, and missiles to kill enemy soldiers throughout the battlefields. Realistic gunfire, explosions, and cries of pain are heard during the frequent and fast-paced combat. The most intense depiction of violence occurs during a 'No Russian' mission where players take on the role of an undercover Ranger: Several civilians are gunned down at an airport as players are given a choice to participate in the killings (e.g., players can shoot a wounded civilian that is crawling on the ground), or walk by and observe without opening fire. In either case, civilians scream and emit pools of blood as they are shot to death. Within the multiplayer portion of the game, players can unlock 'emblems' to be used on their player name cards. Some of these emblems contain images that reference drugs (e.g., a cannabis leaf; a name card with a depiction of a joint). Dialogue in the game contains profanity in both English (e.g., 'sh*t') and Russian (e.g., 'f**k' and 'motherf**ker')."

As players run, jump, and fly through each level, they must avoid hazards (e.g., fireballs, lightning bolts, lava pits) and defeat a variety of creatures (e.g., birds, shrimp, fish, robots, dragons). Most enemies disappear into puffs of smoke when hit. During the course of the game, players must rescue female nymphs that wear revealing outfits (e.g., moderate amounts of cleavage). The dialogue occasionally contains comical remarks and/or references to bathroom humor: “[N]obody ever wanted to share my Boogers on a Stick!”“Stop ogling me,” and “They force-fed you farting beans . . .”"

    "synopsis": "This is an 'open-world' action-adventure game in which players assume the role of John Marston, a reformed criminal on a mission to capture the remnants of his old outlaw gang. Players roam Wild West environments and perform various missions for criminal figures and law enforcement: destroying bridges, helping individuals in distress, delivering packages of drugs (e.g., opium), capturing outlaws, and eliminating rival figures. Players use shotguns, pistols, and rifles to kill enemies in realistic gun battles. Players can engage in melee-style hand-to-hand combat and trigger slow-motion effects by shooting enemies at close-range or by targeted shooting (i.e., aiming for body parts). Blood often spurts out of characters when shot; head shots and knife attacks result in much larger sprays. In one sequence, a bloodied and mutilated corpse can be seen hanging from the rafters of a barn. Players have the ability to shoot pedestrians in the game; however, a 'Wanted Level'-penalty system discourages these acts by triggering a law enforcement response. The game contains a scene in which two characters have sex on a table; there is a brief instance of female nudity. One sequence depicts a man injecting himself with a syringe filled with cocaine. Language such as 'f**k,' 'c*nt,' and 'sh*t' can be heard in the dialogue."

Some cutscenes depict red puffs of blood when characters are struck; small pools of blood also appear in a tower environment. Some cutscenes contain suggestive dialogue (e.g., 'It's just your hand is . . . right on my . . . Penis,' 'This machine is more incredible than my wettest dreams!'and 'I really get off on it. I mean really get off on it . . .'). The word 'sh*t' can be heard in the dialogue."

As players attempt to take over a fictional city and exact revenge on a rival gang, they engage in driving and combat missions to progress the overall storyline. Players use machine guns, shotguns, swords, rockets, and grenades to injure and kill rival gang members. Players also can shoot at roaming pedestrians (though there is no reward for this action), and in one mission, players shoot at police and civilians to create chaos in a rival gang's territory. One scene prompts players to run over a certain number of pedestrians within a given time; another sequence allows players to dispatch enemies by putting grenades in their mouths. Players can also use chainsaws to hack at enemies, resulting in scattered chunks of flesh and large pools of blood. During the course of the game, female characters are sometimes dressed in outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage or buttocks; characters are occasionally depicted nude, though their nipples and/or genitalia are obscured by “pasties” or blurry pixels. In one sequence, players can walk through an erotic club containing several phallic sex toys and sexual contraptions; in another mission, players drive around town while an escort and client engage in sexual activity—there is no depiction of sex, only moaning sounds and suggestive dialogue (e.g., “How deep's that going in?” and “That's some tongue you got there.”). Some game environments and dialogue contain drug paraphernalia or other references to drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves and water bongs on a table; a radio DJ telling a caller to try heroin). The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “c*ck” can be heard in dialogue."

Large blood-splatter effects occur during combat; some weapons cause characters to explode into pools of blood. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: characters executed at point-blank range; players shooting or driving over pedestrians. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted topless, with pasties over their breasts. A handful of sequences depict female pole dancers performing at a strip club. Players can also initiate brief romantic encounters between characters: one scene depicts a robot hovering in front of a male character (fellatio is implied)—there is no depiction of the sex act.

Injured enemies emit large sprays of blood that stain the ground and surrounding walls. Specialty kills (i.e., Skillshots) represent the most intense instances of violence: enemies can be dismembered with explosives; impaled on spikes; and drilled into walls, resulting in body parts breaking into pieces. During the course of the game, players can consume alcohol and kill enemies in order to receive an Intoxicated Skillshot; the screen turns blurry during these sequences. The dialogue contains numerous jokes and comments that reference sexual acts, venereal diseases, and having sex with one's mother (e.g., 'Guess I know where the ol' gal got that limp.').

    "synopsis": "This is an action adventure game in which players assume the role of Nathan Drake, a treasure hunter on a quest to save his friends, find the treasure, and stop a madman from obtaining a great and ancient power. Players can explore ancient ruins in international locales while traversing 3D landscapes embedded with puzzles and traps. Along the way, players will encounter mercenaries/soldiers who will attack with realistic machine guns. Players can brawl with these mercenaries/soldiers, shoot back at them with pistols and rifles, or sneak up on the enemies to perform \"stealth kills\" (e.g., neck-snapping, choke-holds). During gunfights, brief splashes of blood are emitted from characters; more shots—and thus, more blood—are required to kill a growling ice beast. The action sequences are interspersed with cutscenes that are dramatic, but just as often, humorous in tone; a handful of them contain sexual/suggestive innuendo: \"Oh! Is that an ancient Tibetan ritual dagger in your pocket . . . Oh! Maybe I'm just happy to see you\" and \"Well, so much for foreplay . . .\" In one scene, a woman (fully clothed) straddles on top of the central character, places his hands on her hips (he drums his fingers), then kisses him as the camera pans away (to a painting above the bed). In the heat of battle  and  conversation, the words  sh*t ,  b*tch , and  a*s  are sometimes exclaimed."

    "synopsis": "This is an adventure game based on the Walking Dead TV and comic-book franchise. Players assume the role of Lee Everett as he leads a group of survivors through Georgia during a zombie outbreak. As players progress through the story, they are presented with dialogue and action choices. These selections can sometimes lead to the death of characters and sequences that depict intense violence: a woman shooting herself in the head; a man's leg getting amputated with an ax; a man cutting off his own arm; zombies attacking, disemboweling victims. In some sequences, players use realistic firearms or other objects (e.g., hammer and pitchfork) to kill zombies and other human survivors. These sequences are sometimes accompanied by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood. Blood-splatter effects also appear in the surrounding environment and around several corpses. The game contains some suggestive material in the dialogue (e.g., “Might as well leave a sign out that reads, 'The men are out, come rape our women and children'”); in one sequence, a video depicts a man zipping up his pants and a woman buttoning up her blouse. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in dialogue."

Players use firearms (assault rifles, shotguns, pistols), hand-to-hand weapons (fists, knives, clubs), and stealth moves (e.g., neck-snapping, strangulation, and throat-slashing) to kill security personnel, hostile prisoners, and humanoid mutants. Some kills can result in enemies getting stabbed in the eye or being dismembered, resulting in limbs that explode and litter the ground. Red blood often splatters on the environment when enemies are attacked or killed. Players can also encounter a character that masturbates in his prison cell. Although the character's back faces the player during the act, the sequence lasts for about 45 seconds and involves some moaning and shuddering. Dialogue within cutscenes contains some sexual references (e.g., rape and necrophilia) and strong use of profanity (e.g., \"f*ck,\"\"c*nt,\" and \"p*ssies\")."

As players navigate the school, they sometimes come upon various corpses. Players investigate the various crime scenes, looking for clues and interviewing rival classmates.

There are also depictions of characters getting impaled by spikes and knives. Blood is frequently depicted on and around dead bodies. During the course of the game, the dialogue contains suggestive material (e.g., “Like I'd w-want to go anywhere with a dirty slut like you,” “It's not some pervy 'adult' video or anything” and “He...abused me...And he...he took pictures”).

Enemies generally flash and disappear when defeated—some characters emit red puffs to indicate damage. As the game progresses, players can use alcohol-related items to boost various attributes (health, damage resistance, strength, critical hits, etc.); these sequences are often accompanied by comments from the omnipresent narrator: “One sip of these spirits and the kid will feel like a new man,” “I revive the kid with a shot of Werewhiskey,” and “A sip of Lunkhead Liqueur will toughen you up.” In one sequence, the central character briefly puffs from a smoking pipe (e.g., “Poor kid collapses after just one drag.”)."

Players assume the role of Batman as he investigates Arkham City, a neighborhood overrun by psychopathic criminals and former prison inmates. As players explore the city and infiltrate hideouts, they punch and kick criminals in melee-style combat, using various gadgets (e.g., explosive gel, smoke pellets, a grappling gun) to defend themselves against gun-wielding thugs and villains. The frenetic combat is highlighted by cries of pain, punching sounds, realistic gunfire, and slow-motion effects. In some sequences, players must solve puzzles or use stealth to incapacitate enemies and free hostages; when players fail a challenge, the hostage will lose his life. Some environments contain bloodstains on the floor or furniture; other cutscenes depict spots of blood on injured characters. During the course of the game, some female characters are dressed in form-fitting outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; one background sign depicts the silhouette of a woman and the words “Live Nude.” The dialogue also contains some suggestive references (e.g., “The anger, the frustration, the hints of repressed sexual tension” and “Sure could go for some porn right now.”). One sequence depicts a character smoking a cigar, and there are various references to alcohol (e.g., “She got a little drunk and killed her classmates,” “I'd give anything for a nice cold beer right now.”). The words “b*tch,” “a*s,” and “bastard” can be heard in dialogue."

Combat is highlighted by frequent explosions, screams of pain, and gunfire. Some explosives cause enemies to be dismembered, leaving limbs around the environment; one cutscene briefly depicts a character's head cut off by a mutant. During the course of the game, characters and environmental elements reference sexual behavior or humor (e.g., “Oh, such a bold statement! It says, 'I am a prostitute!'” and “How hard was it to make a porn flip book?” ); a radio ad contains a running joke about a sex burger (e.g., “It's so good you won't be able to contain your urges to rub it all over your Sex…Burger”). The dialogue contains a handful of drug references (e.g., “You guys have been eating weed” and “Oh, when I get back with your drugs, we'll discuss my offense at your assumption that I would know where to find drugs”).

Players assume the role of a new kid in town who embarks on various quests with other boys in the neighborhood. Players can engage in turn-based combat, selecting attacks from a menu screen. Players use various weapons (swords, baseball bats, hammers), magic spells and melee attacks during fights; blood-splatter effects sometimes occur. Cutscenes occasionally depict “cartoony” characters dismembered or decapitated. The game includes several instances of mature humor and sexual material: one extended sequence depicts characters getting anally probed by alien creatures; another sequence (in an abortion clinic) depicts doctors using a vacuum to perform procedures on male characters; one level takes place inside the rectum/colon of a character (sex toys, random objects and fecal matter appear in the level)—all sequences are depicted in a cartoony and over-the-top manner. Characters are occasionally depicted nude (e.g., breasts, buttocks, male genitalia); one extended sequence depicts an out-of-focus couple having sex in the background; as players engage in turn-based battle in the foreground, sexual moaning sounds/dialogue is heard. During the course of the game, drug paraphernalia can be seen strewn around a methamphetamine lab. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” “a*shole,” and “f*ggot” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players can also perform stealth attacks (i.e., sneaking up on enemies and slitting throats/stabbing chests).

Some levels/cutscenes depict further violence: characters tortured via electrocution, stabbed repeatedly in the neck, executed with bladed weapons. The game includes some sexual/suggestive material, including dialogue referencing sexual activity (e.g., “The army forces us to take drugs and then gives us more if we do sex for wealthy men”; “Some of the people in my village, the army forced them to become prostitutes”; “I think sex is fun;” “[I] was with this girl and she was into some crazy S&M. . .”).

During the course of the game, two characters are depicted smoking marijuana; players' character also consumes the drug, resulting in blurred-screen effects and occasional hallucinations. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an 'open-world' action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Cole Phelps, a rookie detective on a mission to stop a deranged serial killer. Set in late 1940s Los Angeles, the game allows players to advance through various 'desks' at a police department (i.e., Patrol, Traffic Squad, Homicide, Vice, Arson) by interviewing witnesses and suspects, searching crime scenes for clues, and apprehending criminals. Players use pistols, rifles, machine guns, and flamethrowers to engage in firefights with various enemies—these shootouts are highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood spurts that stain injured characters and the surrounding environment. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence, including a character being beaten with a crowbar (off screen)—large spurts of blood are depicted in the foreground. During the course of the game, players may come across crime scenes in which badly beaten or mutilated corpses are subject to investigation; players are able to examine victims' bodies close-up, surveying various bruises and bloody cuts for evidence—a few female corpses are depicted fully nude with fleeting images of pubic hair. Investigations sometimes pertain to sexual assault crimes, and details are often conveyed in clinical terms through dialogue or on-screen text (e.g., 'He's some kind of sex fiend,' 'Woman's briefs torn at seams, forcibly removed,' and 'Head trauma . . . external bruising to genitals.'). In one cutscene, there is an implication that a character is engaged in a sexual relationship with a teenager (e.g., 'You take love where you can find it as you get older, Jack'/That has nothing to do with love . . .'). Some sequences allow players to collect/manipulate drug-related evidence such as marijuana packets, morphine syringes, or amphetamine pills; in one cutscene, a doctor can be seen injecting a character with morphine. Language such as 'f**k,' 'sh*t,' 'c*nt,' 'n**ger,' and 'sp*c' can be heard in the dialogue."

Battles are won by using each card's various traits to deplete the opponent's health. Several cards depict images of violence: characters using blades to stab/slash each other; characters impaled by arrows/blades. Some of these battle images depict drips or splashes of blood. A handful of cards depict female creatures in revealing outfits (e.g., large amounts of exposed cleavage)."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter featuring two modes of gameplay: single player, in which players control soldiers on a mission to stop terrorists; and multiplayer, in which players engage in team-based combat ('Conquest,' 'Rush,' 'Squad Rush,' and 'Squad Death Match'). Both modes involve using machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, and rockets to kill enemy soldiers on the battlefield. In single-player mode, players conduct missions on an unnamed Japanese island during World War II and then move into the modern day through jungles, deserts, and snowy terrain. The firefights contain realistic gunfire, loud explosions, cries of pain; large sprays of blood come out of injured characters during the fast-paced combat. There are also close-up depictions of knife-stabbing (flesh-impact sounds) and melee attacks with a power drill. Multiplayer mode tends to involve more goal-oriented tasks, such as 'capturing-the-flag,' destroying and defending crates, point-based fighting. Characters use profanity (e.g., 'f**k,' 'sh*t,' and 'a*shole') during cutscenes and in the heat of battle."

As players navigate the island, they sometimes come upon corpses of murdered classmates. Players investigate the various crime scenes, looking for clues and interviewing fellow survivors. Finding the killer can trigger “punishment” cutscenes in which acts of violence are depicted: students thrown into a volcano, trampled by animals, stabbed by sword-wielding robots. A handful of still-frame cutscenes also depict characters impaled by spikes and hanging from ceilings. Blood is sometimes depicted on and around corpses. Cutscenes also depict female characters dressed in low-cut outfits and bikinis that expose large amounts of cleavage; these still images occassionally depict characters in provocative poses, with the camera focusing on pelvic areas. Some scenes contain sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., “That creep rubbed his ham-hands all over me and called it a body check! More like sexual harassment!” “My loins are still full of poison, and I'd appreciate it if you could suck it out…” and “some even tried to have children with Junko's dead body”). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the game."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of Adam Jensen, an ex-cop who must uncover the truth behind a cybernetics company's attack. Players complete mission-based objectives to increase their character's skills (e.g., stealth, strength) and advance the main storyline. Players use pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and explosives to kill a variety of human enemies (e.g., soldiers, police officers, gang members, drug dealers). Players can also use stealth attacks (e.g., choking, electrocution) to dispatch enemies at close range. Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, explosions, and large sprays of blood that stain the surrounding environment. Players can sometimes make choices that result in the death of innocent characters: during one sequence, an injured man asks to be “put out of his misery”—the main character can then administer a morphine overdose. Civilians can also be killed directly, though this may negatively affect players' progress. As the game progresses, alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer, vodka, cocktails) can be purchased and consumed to reduce damage, resulting in a screen-blurring effect. In one mission, players can plant “illegal drugs” in a character's residence; marijuana products (i.e., “cigaweed”) are occasionally referenced in the dialogue. Some missions contain sexual material: a brothel room containing a sex toy on the bed; dialogue with prostitutes (e.g., “They want me to get augmentations . . . for the customer's pleasure. It's sick” and “[W]e can find a quiet spot . . . Do you have enough money for me, sexy?”). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

Some clues and objects can trigger past memories depicting deaths/murders:: a man beaten to death, a man stabbed in the neck with scissors, a character set on fire. One sequence depicts the corpse and severed legs of a victim run over by a train. The word “f**k” appears in the dialogue."

Players can perform tricks, run into cars and pedestrians, and even engage in a \"Hall of Meat\" challenge that rewards players for injuring themselves. Though pedestrians can be attacked with a skateboard, these bystanders may use tazers to stun aggressive players. Skateboard decals depict close-up images of women's buttocks and cleavage; signs around the city contain suggestive innuendo (e.g., \"Strip-a-Grams,\" \"Spooning,\" \"BJ Industries,\" and \"Master Bait & Tackle\"). A skateboard deck image depicts a marijuana leaf under the words \"Think Green.\" Dialogue contains language such as \"sh*t,\" \"p*ssy,\" and \"a*s\"; it also contains some crude humor (e.g., \"\"[D]id you need me to bless it with some of my urine?\" \"Oh, I say do you have a laxative—I need some to release the pressure,\" and \"Hey, you can just stay away from my rear, ya heard me? This ain't prison!\")."

Players use swords, clubs, lances, and magic arrows to kill creatures (e.g., skeletons, demons, ghouls, zombies) in melee-style and ranged combat. Battles are highlighted by slashing sounds, cries of pain, and large splashes of blood. Some scenes depict characters impaled on swords or lying in large pools of blood. Players can also attack and kill non-combatant characters without penalty. Boss battles depict more prolonged combat, often with large-scale enemies."

    "synopsis": "This is an open-world role-playing game in which players assume the role of Geralt, a monster hunter in search of a missing woman. Players explore a war-ravaged world while completing quests and killing enemy soldiers and fantastical creatures (e.g., wraiths, harpies, rock beasts). Characters engage in melee-style combat using swords and other bladed weapons, as well as magical attacks (e.g., blasts of fire, stun spells); combat is highlighted by screams of pain and impact sounds. Large blood-splatter effects occur when enemies are slashed, with some attacks resulting in decapitation or dismemberment. Some cutscenes depict slow-motion decapitations and other gore: an autopsy of a torture victim, rooms with several corpses (e.g., hanging from the ceiling, covered in blood on a bed, naked in a tub). During the course of the game, the central character can engage in sexual activity with prostitutes and female companions. These brief sequences depict females' breasts and buttocks—sexual moaning sounds can be heard, though the camera cuts away from explicit sexual acts. The game includes a side quest in which Geralt engages in a drinking game; characters are depicted drunk and/or passed out. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “c*nt” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players watch events as they unfold and make decisions that affect the storyline. A handful of still-image sequences depict acts of violence: soldiers in firefights; a woman shot in the head; a character stabbed in the chest. Violence is also described in text (e.g., “Fresh blood flew out of the man's head, and his body was blown away as if it has been hit by a truck,” and “An instant later, the knife slit his throat and ended his life.”). Blood is frequently depicted on characters' bodies and around corpses; large blood stains can bee seen on the ground. The game contains some suggestive innuendo and references in the dialogue (e.g., \"'They look bigger when I'm not wearing clothes. They're huge'\" and \"Everything about her was small. I could kind of make out a few of the curves that don't appear until after puberty...\"). There are also brief instances of nudity (i.e., partially exposed breasts and buttocks). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in dialogue."

As players explore various districts and follow the storyline, they engage in missions that often involve fistfights with thugs or rival gang members; characters can also use weapons such as bats during frenetic combat sequences. Players can perform scripted moves after building enough meter; these Heat Actions depict characters breaking necks, slamming heads into walls, and shoving bats inside enemies' mouths.

Cutscenes depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; a bound man tortured with a sledgehammer; a character impaled by spikes. The game contains some sexual content: men groping women's breasts in a night club; a man guiding a woman's hand over his crotch. Players can also opt to visit parlors where they can flirt with women over the phone: close-up images of a bikini-clad woman are shown in the background. During the course of the game, players can order and drink whiskey at a bar—a status icon indicates drunkenness. Another sequence allows players' character to engage in a game of darts after consuming alcohol, as the screen blurs and shakes during play.

Assuming the role of the First Horseman of the Apocalypse (\"War\"), players use giant blades and guns to kill angels, demons, skeletons, zombie-like creatures, and undead horses. The melee-style combat can be intense and frenetic: Players hack-and-slash enemies at a constant rate; screams, rending flesh, and swords clashing/slashing can be heard; and \"quick-kill\" animations depict deaths close-up. This last-mentioned aspect of combat allows players to dismember creatures in dramatic fashion; for example, players can cut off enemies' legs and arms, chop off their heads, snap their necks, or pull off their wings. Dark red blood gushes out of creatures' hearts, necks, and limbs in a fountain-like manner. In one sequence, blood flows out of a statue and forms a river in the grooves of a stone puzzle on the ground. Some female characters—mostly demon-like creatures—are depicted wearing tattered, revealing outfits that expose deep cleavage and portions of their buttocks."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter, set in a fictional city-in-the sky (Columbia), in which players assume the role of a private investigator searching for a mysterious woman. As players explore the city, they encounter a variety of armed guards, thugs, and mechanical creations that attack the central character. Players use pistols, shotguns, rifles, and machine guns to kill these enemies. A three-pronged hook can be used to dismember and decapitate several enemies. Players can also use an assortment of special powers to defeat enemies (e.g., setting characters on fire, electrocuting them). Large blood-splatter effects occur when characters are injured. Enemies are also depicted beating themselves with a bat or shooting themselves in the head when they are possessed; during one sequence, a character intentionally sets herself on fire. During the course of the game, characters sometimes engage in suggestive/sexual dialogue (e.g., “Obscenity and fornication everywhere!”“Could use a good roll in the hay after this,”“I think yeh gave me the clap, ya dirty boy…”). The game allows players' character to obtain \"health\" by consuming beer and whiskey; the screen turns fuzzy and distorted if the player consumes too many drinks. The social/political backdrop of the fictional city (set in the year 1912) includes the use of derogatory ethnic/racial terms (e.g., the words \"gook,\"\"chink,\"\"negroes,\"\"injuns,\"\"crackers\"); language such as \"sh*t\" can also be heard in dialogue."

Players use a wide variety of weapons such as pistols, rifles, machine guns, and explosives to injure/kill enemies. Combat can generate pools of blood and dismembered limbs. Players can use enemy bodies as human shields and execute them at close range. In one sequence, broken glass is placed into the mouth of a man while he is repeatedly punched, causing blood to spill from his mouth. Language such as \"f**k,\"\"b*tch,\" and \"sh*t\" can be heard in the dialogue."

Instead of actually engaging in combat, Guybrush attacks some characters by poking and prodding \"cartoony\" voodoo dolls. In one scene he rips off the leg of a voodoo doll, causing a zombie pirate to lose his arm and leg and spew out splashes of green blood. To solve one of the puzzles, players must compete in a drinking contest during which a character is depicted drinking a mug of grog. The grog is described as having \"twice the alcohol, twice the calories,\" and causes the character to pass out. There is also a scene that depicts a man spitting out green mucus, and players can compete in a spitting contest. The word \"hell\" can be heard once in the dialogue (\"What the hell?\")."

    "synopsis": "In this action role-playing game, players' objective is to defeat an alien enemy that is silently abducting entire human colonies. Players must assemble a team of henchmen, command a space ship, and travel to distant planets across a futuristic galaxy. At its core, the game involves a combination of conversation/interaction with characters, and ground-based (i.e., \"run-and-gun\") space battle: Players use assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and pistols to kill humans, robots, and aliens in the frenetic third-person firefights. Some enemies emit large splashes of blood when shot (particularly with \"head shots\"); several enemies lie stagnant in pools of blood—factors for the Mature rating. Henchmen are able to freeze and shatter enemies, engage in melee attacks, set robots on fire, and use telekinesis to disable aliens. A handful of cutscenes depict dramatic interrogations in which human characters are threatened, punched, kicked, and shot (in the leg) by alien creatures. The game contains themes of illicit drug use, addiction, and trafficking—often focal points to the branching storylines; for example, \"Morinth likes dancing while on a drug called Hallex,\"\"Narcotics flooded my veins when I attacked,\" and \"The asari injecting so many drugs into me was terrifying.\" During the course of the game, players may enter a bar where alien pole dancing exists (choreography highlighted on big-screen monitors) or hear suggestive comments such as \" krogan  sexual deviants enjoy  salarian  flexibility\" and\"if this is just about sex, maybe you should just  f**king  say so.\" [Italics added] Players can also choose to have \"romantic encounters\" with the alien/human henchmen characters; this involves watching a guided cutscene in which two characters flirt, kiss, and/or embrace: clothed alien/human characters may prop a partner on top of a space console, clear away the clutter from a bed-slab, unzip a future-blouse, or just talk it out. Though an alien/human may gyrate her hips while on top (fleeting—one-to-two seconds), actual sexis never depicted—the cameracuts awaytospace furniture and ceilings."

    "synopsis": "This is an \"open-world' action game in which players assume the role of a US operative (Rico) who investigates the disappearance of an agent in a Southeast Asian island country. Players' objective is to de-stabilize the island government by performing various missions: assassination, demolition, \"Stronghold takeovers,\" the rescue of hostages, etc. Players mostly use machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosives to kill enemy soldiers; players can use a grappling hook to scale tall buildings, zip between moving vehicles, or grapple enemies to vehicles and structures. Blood often spurts out of injured characters and stains the ground and walls. Bodies also react to postmortem damage, flailing (i.e., rag-doll physics) and emitting blood long after death. Within the free-roaming context (i.e., not missions), players have the ability to kill island citizens (never children); however, a \"Heat Meter\"-penalty system discourages these acts by attracting government agents and the local militia. During the course of the game, players may be required to transport a female escort to various locations or to visit a brothel called the \"Mile High Club.\" The dialogue contains mild sexual innuendo (e.g., \"[he] was swapping bodily fluids with a well known general\"), as well as more direct references (e.g., \"well renowned for his excessive and deviant sexual habits,\"\"Mile High Club . . . so many sexual memories,\" and \"To the guards you are just another whore hound!\"). The game contains several missions involving drugs: Players must secure drug lines, find hidden drug cases to increase their \"Faction meter,\" and transport drugs via trucks and helicopters. Although there are never any visual depictions of drugs (they are mostly just in cases and crates), the game contains several references to cocaine, amphetamines, heroine, and opium. The dialogue contains profanity—both in English (e.g., \"sh*t\" and \"a*shole\") and Spanish (e.g., \" ch*nga ,\" and \" m*erda \")."

Players traverse a variety of locations around Gotham while battling thugs, examining crime scenes, and occasionally rescuing hostages. Players engage in melee-style combat using punches, kicks, and gadgets (e.g., batarangs, explosives). Enemies cry out in pain when struck, and some takedowns are highlighted by brief slow-motion effects and loud impact sounds. Some sequences allow players to use tank-like vehicles with machine gun turrets and rockets to shoot enemies; a vehicle's wheels are also used to torture an enemy in one sequence. Cutscenes depict characters getting shot (on and off camera) while restrained or unarmed. Large bloodstains/pools of blood appear in crime scenes and in the aftermath of violent acts; one room depicts a person torturing a character on a bloody operating table. During the course of the game, players can shoot unarmed characters and a hostage. Neon signs in a red-light district read “live nude girls” and “XXX.” The words “b*tch,” “gobsh*te,” and “a*s” appear in the dialogue."

Players can develop their nation's culture and technology, manage its economic and social infrastructure (e.g., diplomacy, trade), and expand territory through military conquests. Combat with nations is presented from an overhead perspective, and military units are represented by small armies of soldiers on a gridded map. Battles include brief animations of sword fighting, gun fights, and vehicular combat, resulting in icons exploding, collapsing, or disappearing. Nuclear weapons can be developed and detonated over opposing nation's territories.

Missions allow players to explore the Mojave Desert, surrounding casinos, and abandoned facilities; other quests involve combat with human and mutant survivors. Players use chainsaws, laser rifles, knives, and sledgehammers to kill enemies. Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of dismemberment, blood spray, and blood trails. In one sequence, players can choose to activate a collar bomb around a slave-woman's neck, resulting in depictions of blood and gore. During the course of the game, players will encounter male and female prostitutes: the screen fades to black as suggestive dialogue is heard in the background (e.g., \"Nice charlies, too! Give them a shake for the Ben-man, will ya?\"); there is also an extended sequence suggesting (no depiction) sexual activity with a robot (e.g., \"Fisto reporting for duty . . . Please assume the position,\"\"I suppose I should test you out . . . Servos active!\" and \"Something wrong with someone if they got to f**k a machine.\"). The storyline sometimes references a fictional drug called \"chems,\" as well as \"Day Trippers,\"\"cracked out junkies,\" and \"degenerate, drug-addicted killers.\" Players' Character can be seen consuming the drugs, which sometimes leads to a screen-blurring effect."

Players can socially interact with Sims to build relationships, and are free to pursue more intimate encounters, such as the ability to kiss, \"make out,\" or engage in WooHoo (i.e., sex) with another Sim: this action depicts the Sims squirming, giggling, and moaning under the covers until hearts float around the bed. Sims maintain their health and hygiene through eating, exercising, bathing, and using the toilet. They sometimes vomit, expel flatulent sounds, or urinate on themselves if their hygiene is not properly managed. Some interactions lead to fighting, which is depicted by sounds of struggle and partially obscured \"fight-cloud\" effects; other animations include Sims getting electrocuted by household appliances or dying in fires."

Blood-splatter effects occur when enemies are hit, and damage sometimes results in dismemberment or decapitation—blood stains and body parts occasionally appear in the environment. Other cutscenes depict gore and more intense acts of violence: a close-up view of a severed head; a restrained woman's eyes getting gouged out (off-screen); a character being castrated (not depicted) before his throat is slit. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted topless; there is also a fleeting image of pubic hair as a woman dives into the water. Players can initiate brief cutscene sequences that depict varying degrees of sexual activity: a topless woman rocking on top of man; a man caressing a woman's back; a man pushing up against a woman's posterior—sexual moaning sounds can be heard, though the camera cuts away from explicit sexual acts. Some sequences depict a cocaine-like substance being cut into lines; another scene shows a man's back as he snorts the substance.

Players can also employ close-up stealth attacks (e.g., choking and slitting throats from behind) to defeat enemies. Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and blood-splatter effects (blood also stains the ground). Some games allow non-adversary characters/prisoners to be injured or killed; cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: enemy soldiers executed at point-blank range; a restrained character beaten during an interrogation. A comic-book-style sequence (hand-drawn still images) depicts a young character using a knife to execute captured soldiers. Some games in the collection include suggestive/sexual material: a man briefly groping a character's breasts; a male character's buttocks exposed as he runs through levels. In some sequences, players can enter a cardboard box (\"Love Pack\") to engage in sexual acts with another character—there is no depiction of the sexual acts, though moaning sounds occur. Players also have the ability to unlock a “Snake Beater” award after repeatedly zooming in on a picture of a woman in lingerie. A handful of sequences include depictions of bathroom humor (e.g., a character defecating inside his pants; a character urinating off a platform onto another character). The game includes references to drugs in the dialogue (e.g., “The biggest cocaine consume in the world is the United States\" and \"How'd he get the cocaine?\").

    "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of Death (one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse) on a quest to resurrect the lost souls of humanity and free his brother (War) from an eternal prison. As players traverse through fantastical open-world environments, they use oversized blades to kill demonic/angelic creatures (e.g., dragons, golems, ice skeletons, “corrupted angels”). The melee-style combat is accompanied by screaming/flesh-rending sounds, bone-crunching effects, and exaggerated splashes of blood. Players can also initiate “cinematic kills” that depict additional violence: enemies getting impaled, decapitated, or dismembered (often amid slow-motion effects)—similar imagery can be seen during cutscenes. Some female characters (e.g., harpy-like creatures; a demon) are depicted with large amounts of exposed cleavage."

Players use guns and grenades to kill enemy robots and humanoid soldiers in frenetic combat. When human soldiers are shot, a brief spurt of blood occurs; when an explosive device discharges, human soldiers usually blow up in a splatter of blood and dismembered body parts. Cutscenes sometimes depict intense instances of violence: an unarmed character is shot at close range, resulting in large blood effects; a character commits suicide with a gunshot to the head—the camera pans away from the shot, though a chunk of flesh is depicted flying by. The words \"f**k,\" \"motherf**ker,\" and \"sh*t\" can be heard in the dialogue."

Players punch, kick, and use a variety of weapons (e.g., knives, swords, machine guns, laser blasters) to drain opponents' health meters in melee-style combat. Matches are highlighted by impact sounds, splashes of blood, and colorful light effects as fighters are hurled across the screen or to the ground. As players engage in fantasy combat, they can trigger super attacks and transitional attacks that propel opponents from different levels of fighting arenas. Some super attacks depict blood-splatter effects as characters are injured by creatures and/or impaled with swords. Cutscenes depict additional instances of violence and blood: a character impaled with a sword; a prisoner lying in a small pool of blood; a character stabbed with a trident; a villain's throat slashed off-screen. The game's dialogue contains brief sexual references (e.g., \"They're thieves. Rapists. Murderers.”), and some female characters wear revealing outfits (e.g., deep cleavage, tight-fitting clothing) and/or perform suggestive poses. One fight setting takes place in a bar with several alcohol references: signs that read \"Beer\"'; drunk patrons in the background; kegs of beer that can be thrown at opponents. The word “sh*t” is heard in dialogue."

From a third-person perspective, players move around battlefields and city environments, perform various quests, and battle an assortment of human and fantastical enemies (e.g., demons, titans). Characters use swords, guns, and magic attacks (e.g., exploding fireballs, blasts of ice) to defeat soldiers and oversized animals in frenetic combat. Fights are highlighted by cries of pain, dramatic light effects, and realistic gunfire. A handful of cutscenes depict characters impaled on swords; one cutscene involves a woman being stabbed off-screen; another scene depicts a character with a bloodstained wound. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted topless, with breasts that lack discernible details (i.e., no nipples). The word “sh*t” appears in the dialogue."

As players explore parts of Tokyo, they engage in missions that can involve gang rivalries or fights with thugs. Characters engage in fistfights that involve weapons and scripted special moves (e.g., bashing heads into walls, shoving nails into enemies' faces, slamming heads with car doors). Some scenes allow players to engage in gun fights using machine guns and grenades. Combat is accompanied by gunfire, screams of pain, and large blood-splatter effects. Some cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a bound man tortured with razorblades and spikes; a gangster's fingers sliced by a boss; a character shot in the face. Some missions allow players to become more intimate with female characters; as these relationships escalate, players can earn video clips of real women posing in lingerie, swimsuits, or partially nude in bathtubs (e.g., characters' nipples/genitalia barely covered by soap bubbles). During the course of the game, players can order and drink whiskey at bars/restaurants—a status icon indicates drunkenness; consuming alcoholic beverages provides minor bonuses in combat. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."

The game includes a mission involving prostitutes and a brothel in which a couple can be partially observed having sex (i.e., moaning sounds). Female characters are sometimes depicted topless in the brothel; some rooms contain drawings of figures engaged in various sex acts. During the course of the game, a character briefly mentions an opium pipe. The player's character is depicted drinking alcohol during a sequence of cutscenes; after a time, players must walk and engage in a fistfight while the screen and controls are impaired.

Drug smuggling for the mafia is briefly discussed during a side quest (e.g., “Like illegal drugs…? Maybe they made Iida smuggle drugs for them.”).

    "synopsis": "This is an adventure game in which players control a small boy through hazardous landscapes. From a side-scrolling perspective, the player's character runs, climbs, and solves puzzles in order to escape danger or proceed through the game's environments. Fail scenarios usually result in the character's injury or death: dogs can maul the boy; fan blades can slice the boy in half; shockwaves can blow the boy apart into chunks of flesh. One cutscene depicts a man being crushed in a fall; a large splatter of blood can be seen on the ground."

    "synopsis": "This is a strategy game in which players must guide their people from the Ancient Era through the Spaceflight/Information-Age Eras of human history. Players can develop their nation's culture and technology, manage its economic and social infrastructure (e.g., diplomacy, trade) and expand territory through military conquests. Combat with rival nations is presented from a pulled-back, overhead perspective, and military units are represented by small armies of soldiers on a grid map. Battles include animations of swords clashing, gun fights, and vehicular combat that results in icons collapsing, exploding (in the case of vehicles), or disappearing. Historically based text from Civilopedia entries (i.e., reference text) occasionally includes suggestive material (e.g., “From prostitute to pirate lord. . . not the usual career path for a great admiral,” “John didn't think much of Herod's marriage to his half-brother Philip's wife, the adulterous and incestuous Herodias,” and “When Queen Bodica objected, she was flogged and her daughters raped.”). The game also includes historical references to the opium trade (e.g., \"[T]he Qing rulers objected, and attempted to seize incoming opium shipments, inciting the First Opium War in 1839.\"). The words “bastard,” “damn,” and “hell” appear in text."

    "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players are members of an elite military unit whose mission is to quell an intergalactic threat and disarm a stockpile of seized nuclear weapons. Combat is frequent and fast-paced, as players use a variety of firearms (rifles, machine guns, and shotguns) and explosives (grenades and rocket launcher) to kill enemy soldiers. Red blood spray emits from enemy soldiers when shot, and weapons such as sniper rifles and shotguns can be used to decapitate them. Post-mortem damage can be inflicted on soldiers' bodies, resulting in pools of blood on the ground. During one cutscene, a gravely wounded character retrieves a pistol and shoots himself in the head. The game contains strong profanity (e.g., \"f*ck,\" \"sh*t,\" \"a*shole\") in the dialogue."

Players follow a storyline while commanding races and factions (e.g., elves, lizard men) and engaging in diplomacy. From a top-down perspective, players arrange armies and fantasy creatures on the battlefield, giving commands and observing combat. Battles are highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and depictions of bodies scattered on the battlefield. Cutscenes depict characters stalked and stabbed by assassins, with splashes of pink blood on the screen. Some creatures are depicted with bloody wounds during gameplay. The dialogue occasionally references suggestive material (e.g., “Ah, but the truth is like an expensive wh*re, Jerek. She comes in many dresses and will bend over for any with the money to pamper her”; “[A] man born of dock wh*res, yet calls himself a 'prince'”). Dialogue also references wine, ale, grog, and binge-drinking (e.g., “The favourite dwarf pastime is drinking. 'Gorog' is Khazalid for binge-drinking...”); one cutscene also depicts poisoned wine splashing from a goblet.

Players manage a historical empire, including thousands of troops and sea vessels that can attack enemy countries. While much of the battle preparation and fighting takes place on land and sea maps, players can also direct their units into turn-based combat involving cannons, guns, and other explosives. Some of the more intense depictions of violence are contained within cutscene sequences: an army of British soldiers ambushed by French soldiers; the aftermath of soldiers massacred on the battlefield with small pools of blood surrounding their bodies; a man being executed at the chopping block as the camera fades to red. The game also allows players to build up their country's economy, which can include the construction and management of tobacco plantations and wineries.

As players explore areas in Tokyo and other cities, they engage in missions that involve fistfights with thugs or rival yakuza members; some fights depict characters using weapons such as pistols, bats, sledgehammers, and pipes. Combat is frenetic, highlighted by screams of pain, gunfire and/or impact sounds, blood-splatter effects, and slow-motion special moves. Players can perform scripted moves after building up a meter; these actions include breaking necks or limbs and using the environment to cause damage (e.g., slamming heads into a wall, beating an enemy with a nearby bicycle). Cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; a gangster shoving a man's face onto hot coals; a character stabbing himself in the belly. The game includes sexual/suggestive material: a man briefly groping a woman's breasts in a nightclub; online chat rooms in which players' character flirts with webcam girls; characters removing their shirts/tops while in provocative poses (e.g., “Mm, so warm…It feels incredible”; “Ah…You're so big”). One area depicts a character dressed in an outfit with a cutout that exposes his buttocks. During the course of the game, Kazuma can order and drink whiskey at a bar; a status icon denotes character's level of intoxication, while his movement becomes harder to control. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "In this cinema-style action game, players control one of four main characters whose lives are altered by events surrounding the investigation of the Origami Killer, a serial killer who kidnaps children in public places. Gameplay consists of controlling a character in a fully interactive environment; choosing a variety of action-, dialogue-, and decision-paths based on on-screen prompts; and watching as cinematic cutscenes progress the somewhat dark (film noir-style) storyline.\r\n\r\nPlayers may encounter victims at various crime scenes: a woman (fully clothed) in a bathtub tainted with blood; a child under forensic examination (though the scene is largely narrative and clinical, with no depiction of victim's face or signs of trauma). More direct depictions of violence include the following: a woman squirming and screaming as she catches on fire; a man impaled in the chest with a power drill; a female attacked in her own home by masked male assailants (the scene is prolonged); and a man shot (shown in slow-motion) by police officers. Blood sometimes accompanies the acts of violence—whether triggered or viewed passively.\r\n\r\nThe most intense instance of violence occurs during a 'lizard trial' sequence in which players' character, Ethan, is forced to cut off a segment of his own finger to save his son's life: Several instruments (saw, scissors, knife, etc.) can be used to remove the finger; and though the camera pans away from the actual dismemberment—instead the blade, the blood, the scream—the scene's poring focus on Ethan's psychological tenor/terror (the dread deliberation before the cut) may be unnerving for some.\r\n\r\nThe game contains sexual content and nudity. Shower cutscenes may depict a male character's bare butt; if players control the female character, her breasts and buttocks are also briefly visible. A more prolonged instance of nudity occurs during a female character's investigation of a seedy club owner: After getting him alone in a room, the player-character is asked to strip; at gunpoint, she dances topless in front of the man. The game also contains a prompt-based love scene (kissing and rubbing) in which players match on-screen cues to angle characters' mouths, remove shirts and blouses, unhook bras, and lower to the floor; a woman briefly appears topless amidst the dark shadows and heavy breathing—actual sex is never depicted as the camera fades to black.\r\n\r\nThe camera does not fade on characters addicted to the fictional drug Triptocaine, referred to as 'dope' in the game: Players may see a character trembling next to open vials; lines of cut white powder on a table; and a man staggering from the drug's ill-effects, as the screen turns blurry. Consumers may also wish to know that the game contains strong profanity (e.g., 'f**k,' 'motherf**ker,' 'sh*t,' and 'a*shole'). Overall, the game's highly evolved motion-capture graphics (advanced renderings by 2010 standards) sharpen the sense of realism, increasing the impact of some aspects of pertinent content (the nudity, blood, violence, etc.)."

Players use a variety of firearms (e.g., pistols, machine guns, missiles, grenades, mines, sniper rifles) and mech-style robots called Titans to seek out and kill enemy forces. Titans use their robotic arms to punch soldiers and vehicles and can also use large-scale firearms (e.g., chain guns, mine launchers, electric pulse guns) to kill enemies. Combat is frenetic and realistically depicted, with frequent cries of pain, impact sounds, and blood splashes. Some weapons blow enemies apart into small chunks of flesh; Titans can also punch enemy soldiers or crush enemy Titan pilots until they burst into chunks.

Players explore parts of Tokyo and Osaka and engage in missions that often result in fistfights with thugs and/or rival gang members. Characters use knives, pipes, and swords during combat and can trigger scripted special attacks (e.g., bashing heads into walls; stabbing enemies with a knife; ripping off nails and teeth with pliers) after successfully building up an attack meter. Combat is accompanied by screams of pain, large blood-splatter effects, and close-up camera angles. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; characters gunned down inside an elevator; a man executed with a shotgun. The game includes sexual/suggestive material: a sequence in a video parlor in which players hear suggestive moaning sounds and dialogue (e.g., \"You wanna see what I'm hiding under my skirt?\" and \"[Y]ou're giving me some real pervy looks!\"); a mini-game in which players engage in a photoshoot and view videos of real women posing in revealing outfits (e.g., lingerie, swimsuits)—some clips depict camera angles that focus on models' cleavage and buttocks. During the course of the game, Kazuma can order and drink alcoholic beverages at various bars: players are rewarded for drinking in the form of experience points; a status icon denotes character's level of intoxication, while his movement becomes harder to control.

Players use bows, pistols, shotguns, rifles, and explosives to kill enemies in frenetic combat; shooting enemies occasionally triggers a close-up, slow-motion view of enemies getting shot and killed. Players can also use tomahawks and knives to perform stealth kills to eliminate enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur during battle, and some weapon attacks result in decapitation and/or dismemberment, leaving bloodstains and body parts on the ground. Campsites and cabin environments sometimes depict severed body parts and corpses with exposed viscera. Players may also engage in various criminal activities (e.g., robbing banks, shooting civilians), though this will negatively impact players' progress (e.g., wanted status, pursuit by lawmen and/or bounty hunters). Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a man executed from the gallows; a character shooting himself in the head; a man repeatedly electrocuted; a bound man set on fire. The game contains instances of nudity and brief sexual content: a woman (breasts exposed) straddling a man inside a brothel; a spanking scene that is depicted from a distance and includes a fleeting depiction of male genitalia; sexual moaning sounds inside a tent; male characters with exposed genitalia in non-sexual settings (e.g., a man swimming in a river, corpses on the ground). During the course of the game, players' character can engage in a drinking mini-game in which alcohol is poured for drunken bar patrons; players' character is also depicted drinking alcohol, sometimes resulting in screen-distortion effects and impaired controls. One of the stimulant power-ups is known as Cocaine Gum, which players' character can chew; in one scene, characters can briefly be seen smoking from an opium pipe. The words “f**k,” “n**ger,” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

Cutscenes depict instances of intense violence: characters shot in the head at close range; a restrained character struck repeatedly with a hammer (mostly off screen). A fictional drug called Spice is prevalent in the game, as well as other drug references: bags of Spice, drug labs, drug-making paraphernalia depicted; the words \"Drug Kitchen\" written on some walls. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."

During the course of the game, some female characters perform suggestive taunts and poses, including opening their legs or gyrating their hips. Some of the more provocative outfits are shed during battle, resulting in brief depictions of buttocks and breasts. The camera occasionally pans close-up on breasts as they are jiggling.

As players complete mission-based objectives, they use pistols, shotguns, rifles, and cybernetic weaponry to kill human enemies and cybernetically-enhanced soldiers. Players can also use both lethal and non-lethal stealth attacks to incapacitate enemies at close range. Realistic gunfire, large explosions, and blood-splatter effects frequently occur during firefights. Civilians and police officers can also be killed directly, though this may negatively affect players' progress. The game contains sexual material: text/dialogue referencing prostitution (e.g., “Like what you see? You can see it up close for the right price” and “Do not trust the rest of the whores in Prague sweety, stick with the red-light professionals.\"); women in revealing outfits pole-dancing inside a club; window parlors depicting men and women dancing in their underwear. Some billboards in a red-light district depict topless woman. During the course of the game, alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer, ale, absinthe) can be purchased and consumed, resulting in a screen-blurring effect. A handful of scenes depict drug paraphernalia on a table and dealers selling fictional drugs to customers; text also references drug use (e.g., “If it gets back to Otar you are using, you'll be strung up. . . We can't pollute ourselves like the clanks do”). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game."

One enemy is called “Bloody Hand,” and is represented by a disembodied hand dripping with red, slime-like blood. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters wearing low-cut tops or bunny outfits; male characters caught with “girlie magazines” (e.g., Ogler's Digest); innuendo in the dialogue (e.g., “Wilt thou sample the sensual puff-puff for a mere 20 gold coins?”; “Art thou not alive with pleasure?”; “Does that feel good? You'll tell me if it hurts, won't you?”). During the course of the game, characters can enter a casino and bet tokens on games such as slot machines, roulette, and poker. Some characters are depicted drunk (e.g., slurring their speech, hiccupping) in pubs and/or party environments. Players have the ability to acquire horse manure as in inventory item; one cutscene depicts a character placing a lump of feces in a creature's hand."

Players perform quests, level-up combat skills, and fight enemy clans in turn-based combat. Players select attack moves/spells from a menu before watching characters punch, kick, and throw each other; spells/special moves include blasts of fire and over-the-top assists (e.g., a man attacking with a giant grater). Finishing moves can trigger slow-motion effects and camera zooming that highlight violent acts. Blood effects accompany several moves (e.g., stabbing/slashing). Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a man poking out the eyes of a rival with his thumbs; a character shot in the head; a bound man beaten with pipes and bats—blood effects sometimes embellish these acts. The game contains some sexual material: characters discussing selling porn videos to underage kids; a special move (Extreme Bondage Attack) depicting a woman in lingerie tying up the targeted enemy; characters cleaning up soiled tissues in a brothel (e.g., “Bodily fluids really aren't my thing.”). During the course of the game, players can visit bars to order alcoholic beverages, regaining health during battles (character status is sometimes listed as \"sh*tfaced\"); characters are sometimes seen stumbling and slurring their speech when drunk.

    "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players control a group of enforcers called Rangers. Players work to find supplies, end civil war, and bring order to the Patriarch of a post-apocalyptic Colorado. From a top-down perspective, players interact with various characters and engage in turn-based battles with enemy factions. Characters use guns, explosives, and melee weapons (e.g., hammers, clubs) to kill enemies. Battles are highlighted by explosions, cries of pain, and large blood-splatter effects. Some cutscenes depict more intense instances of violence: a character's head exploding at close range, with blood splattering the camera; a head falling off a corpse after its body gets jostled; several corpses hanging from nooses; a body dropping from a high platform, resulting in large blood-splatter effects. During the course of the game, players' character can visit a brothel and pay prostitutes for their services. Although no sex acts are depicted, sexual moaning/grunting sounds occur after transactions with prostitutes are made. One male character (fully clothed) is shown performing a masturbatory gesture, while stating “Can't stop…touching myself.” The game contains a handful of drug references (e.g., a drug cartel's processing plant; tables with mounds and lines of white powder); players can obtain and use a variety of drug-like enhancements, which result in prolonged screen-blurring/distortion effects. The words “f**k” and “c*nt” appear in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action adventure game in which players use electrical super powers to subdue urban gangs in a post-apocalyptic world. Presented from a third-person perspective, the game allows players to roam around the \"open world\" environment and electrocute anyone at any time, including civilians and security/police forces. While players receive \"good karma\" points for killing gang members, they are penalized with \"bad karma\" for attacking the pedestrians, objects, and other neutral parties. Combat is often frenetic and includes explosions, cries of pain, and brief blood splashes to indicate damage. Some of the more striking imagery is contained in the comic-book-panel cutscenes: Civilians are seen getting hit by a barrage of machine gun fire; security/prison guards appear gravely injured with patches of blood on their uniforms; silhouettes of impaled corpses hang from large beams. While most of these still images are highly stylized and fleeting, they serve to embellish the dark, apocalyptic tone of the storyline. During the course of the game, a boss character named Sasha appears covered in a tar-like substance, which leaves her cleavage exposed. She sometimes makes suggestive comments during battle (e.g., \"Yes! Yes, I love it!\" and \"We stayed in bed the entire time…\"). Some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t\" and \"b*tch\") can be heard in the dialogue, and a reference to drug dealers is contained in the narration."

From a third-person perspective, players roam around \"open-world\" environments and use element-based projectiles (e.g., lightning bolts, ice spikes, power grenades) to kill mutated monsters, animal-like creatures, and gun-toting soldiers. Combat is often frenetic and includes explosions, cries of pain, and brief blood splashes to indicate damage. Players have the ability to attack pedestrians wandering through the city and Bio Leech them while they are lying on the ground; this electrical attack sucks the life out of the injured character. In one comic book–style cutscene, a character uses a rifle butt to strike a civilian, resulting in a blood-splatter effect. As the game progresses, players can explore a red-light district that contains advertisements infused with sexual references/innuendo (e.g., \"Sex,\" \"Live Nude Girls,\" \"Erotic Peep Show,\" and \"Latch It and Skank\"); some neon signs also depict silhouettes of pole dancers. During the course of the game, players can create their own missions and assign \"drunk\" characteristics (e.g., \"Happy,\" \"Sloppy\") to non-playable characters; in one cutscene, two men are depicted drinking beer until they fall asleep. Another cutscene contains a brief drug reference (e.g., \"What happened, old guy slip you a roofie?\"). The words \"sh*t\" and \"b*tch\" can be heard in the dialogue."

From a 3/4–overhead perspective, players control animal- and human-like warriors who use swords, arrows, guns, and magic attacks to kill opponents' minions in melee-style combat. Higher kill counts result in additional achievements (e.g., “leveling up”). Battles are accompanied by slashing sounds, colorful projectiles, and red blood splashes; one vampire warrior's attacks cause larger blood-pooling effects. A variety of female characters are depicted in form-fitting outfits that expose mild cleavage; suggestive jokes can occasionally be heard in the dialogue (e.g., “Sorry boys, I keep the fuzzy cuffs at home,”“Is that a rocket in your pocket?” and “For only $2.95 a minute, I'll leave you breathless.”). One playable character drinks frequently from an oversized cask, slurring phrases such as “The only time I have a drinking problem is when I spill it”; his Drunken Rage ability can be used to reduce inflicted damage.

Players explore a futuristic fantasy world, interact with characters, engage in various quests, and battle both humans and creatures (e.g., robots, mutant skeletons, organic shadows) in melee-style combat. Players use swords, spears, and lances to hack/slash at enemies, and a floating book to fire lasers from a distance. Battles are frenetic, often accompanied by explosions, screen-shaking effects, and large blood splatters that stain the ground. Bloodstains are also seen around several corpses. Some sequences depict additional acts of violence: a woman impaled through the chest by a giant spear; a giant shadow creature impaled by a wood column. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters wearing lingerie during battle; a character with partially exposed buttocks and breasts; close-up camera angles of characters' cleavage. The words “f**k,” “a*shole,” and \"sh*t\" are heard in the game."

Players assume the role of a young survivor who traverses the underground tunnels and above-ground remnants, battling humans and mutant creatures along the way. Players use pistols, shotguns, automatic rifles, crossbows, and pipe bombs to kill enemies lurking in the darkness. Melee attacks involve close-up hand-to-hand combat using knives and bayonets. Large plumes of dark blood splash out of humans and mutants when injured; blood may also stain walls, floors, and players' screen (the visor). Characters sometimes use profanity (e.g., \"f**k\" and \"sh*t\") in the dialogue. During the course of the game, players may encounter a prostitute character whose dialogue is sprinkled with sexual innuendo (\"You like what you see?,\" a \"special price,\" and \"I'll show you a good time,\" etc.); though players may follow the woman to her room and exchange currency, the sequence is pre-empted by an in-game event. The game includes a sequence in which players can approach a vendor who states, \"If you're here for the dope, I've got plenty\"; players' character can then inhale from a hookah and experience drug-like effects—blurry vision, losing balance, vomiting."

Players traverse open-world environments, interact with characters, complete quests (e.g., assassination), and infiltrate enemy strongholds. Players use samurai swords, poisoned darts, and bows to battle enemies in melee-style combat. Some attacks result in dismemberment and/or decapitation of enemy soldiers, often accompanied by large blood-splatter effects. Players can also perform assassination kills (e.g., neck stabbing, sword impalement) to dispatch enemies quietly. Cutscenes depict additional acts of intense violence: a soldier lit on fire and beheaded; bound civilians lit on fire and burned at the stake; a decapitated man's head held up towards the screen. The game also depicts a man's exposed buttocks as he bathes in a hot spring. The word \"sh*t\" can be heard in the game. This game contains frequent depictions of extreme violence to human characters. During a number of missions, characters can be seen being decapitated and dismembered. In these instances, strong blood and gore effects are present on impact of the attack. The bodies then slump to the floor and remain there. This game also contains depictions of violence towards defenceless human characters. In these instances, characters are often restrained then beaten/killed. The most pertinent example of this is when an enemy solider is tied to a wooden stake and then burnt to death. He can be seen screaming in pain as his body and clothes catch alight. He then slumps down as his body burns."

    "synopsis": "Infected zombie-like creatures roam the bayous, backwoods, streets, and parishes of a distinctly Southern United States in this first-person shooter set in the aftermath of apocalyptic pandemic. Groups of one-to-four players (i.e., the \"Survivors\") work cooperatively to battle the \"Infected\" zombies and reach safehouses at the end of each round/chapter. Player-Survivors use realistic pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, and assault rifles to kill hordes of zombies throughout the game; chainsaws, machetes, axes, and baseball bats can be used in frenetic close-quarter combat (i.e., melee attacks). In most cases, large sprays of blood shoot out of injured zombies, and they can stain the ground, walls—players' screen; for example, the \"Boomer\"-Infected explode in a shower of blood and bile when shot, which clouds players' view of the impending zombie swarm. Bladed melee weapons and direct hits from rifles, shotguns, etc., cause decapitation or dismemberment; intense depictions include: piles of the Infected in a pool of blood along the roadside; intestines spilling out of abdominal wounds; zombie gibs shooting in all directions; charred innards; and skeletal bits and unclaimed torsos. While the litany of somewhat \"gruesome\" depictions attests to the Mature rating, the over-the-top onslaught is, in some ways, mitigated by the exaggerated menacing evil (camp?) of the drone-like zombie horde; the genre homage (horror, zombies, . . . cricket paddle ) is palpable. Consumers might alsowish to know that the game includes profanity, such as \"sh*t,\"\"a*shole,\" and \"b*tch\"; however, it is the intense violence , the blood and gore that are the primary factors for the Mature rating."

    "synopsis": "This is an action/role-playing game in which players assume the role of Zagreus, the son of Hades, as he attempts to escape the underworld. From a pulled-back ¾ perspective, players battle their way through dungeons filled with mythological enemies (e.g., giant rats, furies, gods). In addition to melee weapons such as swords and hammers, players can acquire magical powers associated with the major Greek gods/goddesses. Combat is frenetic, with frequent explosions, impact sounds, and light effects. Some attacks produce small splatters of blood, and game environments depict blood streaks/stains. The game contains some suggestive material: a character portrait depicting a goddess with long strands of hair covering her breasts and groin; an implied sex scene in which the screen turns black as giggling and whipping sounds are heard. During the course of the game, the god of wine, Dionysus, appears with a chalice of wine; his attack moves contain references to alcohol (e.g., “Drunken Flourish,” “Curse of Nausea,” “Premium Vintage”). The word “bastard” appears in the dialogue."

Players traverse a fantasy world and hunt down and kill various dragons, wyverns, and giant spiders. Players use swords, hammers, bows, and axes to kill creatures in frenetic melee-style combat. Spurts of blood are often depicted when players and creatures are injured during combat. A handful of missions allow players to operate mounted turrets and cannons to shoot rampaging creatures. The game contains several references to alcohol in the dialogue (e.g., “Enjoy the occasional drink and you'll never need a docto—*hic*”; “I had a couple of sips of alcohol…”; “Drinking alone ain't the worst thing, but booze tastes better with company”; “Pops tells the story whenever he gets boozed up.”)."

    "synopsis": "In this open-world action game, players assume the role of three criminals whose storylines intersect within the fictional city of Los Santos. Players can switch between each character to follow his storyline, completing missions which often include criminal activities (e.g., stealing cars, executing heists, assassinating targets). Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosives to kill various enemies (e.g., rival gang members); players also have the ability to shoot non-adversary civilians, though this may negatively affect players' progress as a penalty system triggers a broad police search. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and the game contains rare depictions of dismemberment. In one sequence, players are directed to use various instruments and means (e.g., pipe wrench, tooth removal, electrocution) to extract information from a character; the sequence is intense and prolonged, and it involves some player interaction (i.e., responding to on-screen prompts). The game includes depictions of sexual material/activity: implied fellatio and masturbation; various sex acts that the player's character procures from a prostitute—while no nudity is depicted in these sequences, various sexual moaning sounds can be heard. Nudity is present, however, primarily in two settings: a topless lap dance in a strip club and a location that includes male cult members with exposed genitalia in a non-sexual context. Within the game, TV programs and radio ads contain instances of mature humor: myriad sex jokes; depictions of raw sewage and feces on a worker's body; a brief instance of necrophilia (no nudity is depicted). Some sequences within the larger game allow players to use narcotics (e.g., smoking from a bong, lighting a marijuana joint); cocaine use is also depicted. Players' character can, at various times, consume alcohol and drive while under the influence. The words “f**k,”“c*nt,” and “n**ger” can be heard in the dialogue."

Players assume the role of Batman as he fights (never kills) his way through a psychiatric hospital populated by psychopathic criminals and humans infected with a toxic virus. Players can punch, kick, and use weapons (spikes, light beams, and other gadgets) to defend against the onslaught of enemies. Some attacks are highlighted by special effects, such as slow-motion hits and close-ups of damage inflicted. During the course of the game, players can enter rooms with blood stains on the ground and walls or witness the \"infected\" twitching and screaming in pain. Some inmates and guards are strewn unconscious/dead on the asylum floors, while others are tied-up, strapped to torture devices, or are being tortured (e.g., a guard suffering in an electric chair). Two female characters wear provocative outfits that expose deep cleavage and/or partial buttocks, and one of them moans suggestively when she is in peril. Players are occasionally required to identify and track traces of whiskey/tobacco during missions. Some expletives (e.g., \"b*tch,\"\"damn,\" and \"pissed\") can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "In this first-person shooter, players assume the role of Subject Delta, a genetically enhanced human (a \"Big Daddy\") who roams the underwater city of Rapture to protect a breed of \"Little Sisters.\" Players' objective is to escape the city and thwart the plans of a villain who controls Rapture's citizens, who is creating large numbers of Little Sisters. As players explore Rapture's dark and dangerous wasteland, they will encounter its hostile mutated citizens, who attack and attempt to kill Delta on sight. Players use rivet guns, giant drills, and firearms (spear rockets, Gatling guns, shotguns, etc.) to defend themselves against the horde of frenzied humanoids. Special powers such as telekinesis, electricity, and fire/freezing can also be used to kill the attacking populace. Intense acts of violence are as follows: players can use telekinesis to bring enemies close-up before drilling them to death—blood splatters in all directions; players can freeze enemies and allow them to shatter into pieces; players can set fire to enemies, or electrocute them in standing pools of water. In addition to the spurts of blood from combat, players will sometimes encounter smears of blood on walls and floors, and corpses lying in pools of blood—or spiked onto walls with rivets. When players come across a \"special\" corpse, they may set down the Little Sister and allow her to harvest ADAM (a DNA-modifying substance); the depiction of a child-like creature using a needle to draw fluid from a corpse can be somewhat unsettling (though overtly fantastical). Consumers may wish to know that the game contains minor sexual content. While exploring Rapture's Red Light District, players can overhear conversations alluding to prostitution (e.g., \"Hello there, how much? . . . Twenty bills and I'm all yours, sailor.\"); players may also see a variety of ads and signs for strip clubs (e.g., \"Eve's Garden XXX\")—these brief scenarios contribute to the Sexual Themes descriptor (i.e., the violence and profanity account for the Mature rating). The game includes frequent use of strong profanity (e.g., \"f**k,\" \"motherf**ker,\" and \"c*nt\") and some lesser four-letter words (e.g., \"sh*t\" and \"tw*t\"); in one instance, an enemy attacks Delta while screaming, \"F**king sodomites everywhere!\" [italics added]"

    "synopsis": "Players \"relive\" the life of an assassin during the Italian Renaissance in this open-world action adventure game. The goal is to exact revenge upon conspirators who have framed and executed loved ones; the goal is to be accomplished through assassination. As players roam the crowded streets of Florence, Italy, they can creep through catacombs and corridors, undertake diverse side-missions, and tail-and-assassinate all manner of human targets—politicians, Templar soldiers, conspirators. Players can also brawl with family rivals or engage in sword fights with Templar soldiers, but in most cases, they use stealth techniques to complete the mission; for example, players can sneak up on enemies from behind and kill them with hidden daggers, poisoned daggers, spring-activated blades, and swords. When blades connect, blood shoots out in a fountain-like manner as targets groan or scream. These stealth-kills are sometimes depicted close-up and are somewhat graphic: the camera follows the \"herky-jerky\" thrusts of the blade; the player hears a distinctly \"wet\" flesh-impact sound. The most graphic depictions of violence occur during cinematic cutscenes (the following two scenes do not involve players' character): A businessman, crawling away from a Templar leader, gets pinned to the ground by a sword through his neck; a young nobleman is ambushed by rivals, begs for mercy, then gets stabbed multiple times in the chest amid screams of \"Muori! Mouri! Mouri!\" [Die! Die! Die!]. The spurts and sprays of blood that accompany some of the stabbing attacks can be intense. The game contains strong sexual overtones. During one \"seduction mini-game,\" players are able to press buttons to kiss a woman and remove her dress; with the woman's back facing the camera, the two characters lower to bed and blow out a candle. Some scenes take place inside brothels, though no nudity or sexual acts are depicted. The dialogue contains the following sexual references: \"So the whip or the paddle today?\" and \"Does your wife know about your page-boy fantasies, Captain?\" Character backstories, narrated through still-frame vignettes, explain how villains and historical figures achieved their notoriety; some biographies include references to adultery, sodomy, prostitution, and rape (e.g., \"Caterina was captured and sent to Rodrigo Borgia . . . who kept her imprisoned for a year and is rumored to have raped her alongside his son.\"). One cutscene depicts a man and a woman wearing translucent, flesh-toned bodysuits as they flee from danger. The digitized lighting effects, the glow from their futuristic suits, obscure most of the details, though outlines of breasts and buttocks are partially discernable (i.e., not definitively nudity). Consumers may also wish to know that the game contains strong profanity, both in English and Italian (e.g., \"f**k,\"\"sh*t,\" c*zzo,\" and \"m*rda\"); the most explicit instance occurs when a man frantically describes a \"vision\"—\"I'm at the opera . . . the soprano is so beautiful . . . I'm in bed with her, she cries as I f**k her.\""

    "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control a group of mythical warriors through missions and battles in the ravaged lands of Ferelden. The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person role-playing games where the user does not usually have direct control over combat moves. Instead, players select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, dragon, bear, etc.) and an action (e.g., \"attack,\"\"kill,\" and magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage by emitting splashes of red blood; pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. The most intense instances of violence occur when players have the option to kill non-combatant civilians: A prisoner can be stabbed to death in order to steal a key; a merchant who overcharges refugees can be slashed in the throat; and a boy possessed by an evil demon can be killed off-screen. During the course of the game, players are able to visit a brothel where a hostess asks what they are interested in. If players select \"Surprise me,\" they can sometimes wind up face-to-face with a woman, a man, a transsexual, or an animal; sexual activity is never depicted during these brothel encounters. Players can also initiate brief cutscene sequences in which couples (male and female or same sex couples) can be depicted kissing, embracing, and caressing one another as the screen fades to black. Though the game never features human nudity, one female demon character is briefly depicted with bare breasts. Some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t,\"\"b*tch,\" and \"a*s\") can be heard in the dialogue."

Players travel across various lands, interact with characters, and engage in battle against humans and fantasy creatures (e.g., hyena-/jackal-like animals, demons, skeletons). Players use swords, spears, and magic spells to kill several opponents. Combat can be frenetic at times, accompanied by clashing sounds and brief yells. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence: an extended off-screen sequence in which a character is stabbed; a man shot off-screen while crawling away. Dark blood stains appear on the floors of one level. The game includes some suggestive/sexual material: female characters dressed in revealing outfits; camera angles that pan suggestively on bodies; women offering companionship to men in a coastal city; dialogue that states “[s]tay clear from them two. Gave me the crotch rot, they did!” Players occasionally encounter characters who consume alcohol (e.g., “Jussone more cup, littlemann! Hic!”). The word “sh*te” appears in dialogue."

    "synopsis": "In this massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game, based on the Star Wars universe, players engage in a fictional conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Players can choose from classic Star Wars roles (e.g., Jedi Knight, Bounty Hunter, Trooper) and complete quests to determine their path down the light or dark side of the Force. Players use light sabers, laser blasters, and telekinetic powers to battle a variety of human-like enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., aliens, cyborgs); battles frequently depict characters getting shot with lasers, slashed with light sabers, or shocked with lightning bolts. During the course of the game, players are presented with interactive cutscenes in which their choices play a vital role in the outcome of their story (e.g., using electrical attacks on restrained characters to collect information; killing someone instead of letting him go). Some sequences depict brief instances of blood and gore: to complete one quest, players must dip a skull in a pool of blood; in another mission, players deliver a severed head to a specific location and place it on a pike. Players can freely explore many areas in the game, including clubs that depict scantily clad female dancers with exposed cleavage; some sequences include dialogue with sexual innuendo (e.g., “An hour. I think I'm insulted. We'll need the whole night,” “I'll be sure to make conjugal visits,” and “Come, dear, let's forgo the nuptials and proceed to the honeymoon.”). The words “damn” and “hell” can be heard in dialogue throughout the game. Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB (Windows PC)"

Players engage in turn-based combat by moving around a grid and selecting attacks from a menu. Players use various weapons (e.g., blades, claws), blasts of energy/ice/lightning, and melee attacks during combat. Blood-splatter effects occur often, and cutscenes occasionally depict “cartoony” dismemberment or decapitation. The game includes several instances of mature humor, racial humor, and sexual material: characters are depicted urinating and defecating; one extended sequence (in a strip club) depicts a character performing a lap dance while emitting flatulence; one scene depicts a towel character performing an obscured sex act on a man in an alley; another scene shows a man watching security monitors and repeatedly reaching for lubrication behind his desk—all sequences are depicted in a cartoony and over-the-top manner. Characters are sometimes depicted nude (e.g., breasts, buttocks, male genitalia). During the course of the game, players can observe characters snorting lines of cocaine, and in one level, players must complete a quest to bring a marijuana prescription to a character. The words “f**k,” \"c*nt,\" and “sh*t,” and racial epithets (e.g., \"n**ga,\" \"sp*ok\") are heard in the dialogue. Platform: Windows PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One"

    "synopsis": "Fallout 3 is a action role-playing game set in the barren wasteland of a post-apocalyptic society. Players assume the role of a resident of an underground complex who emerges from a vault to explore a wastleland universe through a series of quests/missions. Mission objectives sometimes involve exploring various caves, sewers, and subway tunnels, while other quests involve combat with human and mutant survivors. Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of realistic dismemberment with trails of red blood. In one scene, players enter a black-and-white virtual reality simulation in which they use a kitchen knife to kill household members and pets. Characters are sometimes seen consuming fictional drugs (e.g., \"Buffout,\" \"Jet,\" and \"Mentats\"), while the player can also use – with no visual depiction of consuming/administering – a narcotic called \"psycho,\" which with repeated uses leads to addiction. A screen-blurring effect indicates the state of characters' intoxication and the need to use the narcotic to fend off various side effects. Several of the characters are prostitutes and the details of their sexual activities are mildly insinuated (e.g., \"You got the cash I got the time…I take care of men around here.\"). Strong profanity can also be heard throughout the game (e.g., \"f*ck,\" \"a*shole,\" and \"sh*t\")."

From a top-down perspective, players use swords to briefly strike creatures and deplete their health meters. A handful of creatures emit small splashes of blood when defeated. One area contains a casino in which players can wager coins on slot machines and blackjack-style card games. During the course of the game, characters are occasionally depicted smoking pipes or cigarettes; players can also drink mugs of beer, sometimes resulting in a temporary “tipsy” status effect. The word “damn” appears in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This game contains sustained depictions of death to human-like characters. Throughout the game the player will relive the last moments of a character’s life. The lead up to the deaths is portrayed only through audio and subtitles. When the death occurs, the scene becomes a still 3D image which you can freely explore and view from multiple angles. Some of the deaths are particularly gruesome, such as a man being ripped in half by a kraken, and a group of men whose necks are being crushed by the claws of a large crustacean. While these images are particularly gruesome, the fact that they are still images, paired with such a highly artistic style lessens the impact of the violence. The audio can be highly disturbing with the sounds of characters screaming in pain and bones breaking."

    "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players follow soldiers as they attempt to uncover secret plots and prevent a war. From a third-person perspective, players explore fantasy settings, interact with characters, and engage in battles with enemy soldiers and creatures (e.g., fish-like monsters, robots, jaguars). Combat is turn-based, with players selecting attack moves from a menu before watching brief cutscenes of their fighters slashing swords. A handful of cutscenes depict splashes of blood (e.g., a character with a bloody chest wound); in one sequence, blood-splatter effects occur during combat with fish-like enemies. The game contains some suggestive material: a character groping a female character's chest under her armor/chest plate, with accompanying dialogue (e.g., \"Hmm, the armor makes 'em seem small, but they're actually about as big as Lady Bell's.”); a student flirting with her teacher (e.g., \"A student and her instructor alone in a quiet classroom...Truly an ideal setting.\"). A few scenes depict characters drinking alcohol; one scene shows a character smoking a cigarette. The word \"sh*t\" can be heard in the game, and a character can be seen holding up his middle finger."

    "synopsis": "Rating Summary This is an action game in which players assume the role of Joel and Ellie, human survivors battling their way through a post-apocalyptic world. From a third-person perspective, players traverse through city ruins and use a variety of weapons (e.g., pistols, rifles, explosives, spiked bats, steel pipes, and blades) and melee attacks to fight off infected mutants and other human survivors. Players can also employ stealth kills (e.g., strangulations, pistol executions, stabbing attacks) and engage in extended combat sequences involving close-up camera angles and on-screen prompts. Screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and blood-splatter effects accompany the combat. Several attacks result in decapitations and dismemberment; body parts are depicted in some areas (e.g., chopping blocks). Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a young character dying in a man's arms from gunshot wounds; adult characters being executed at point-blank range; an enemy getting interrogated and stabbed in the knee. During the course of the game, a character makes sexual remarks about an adult magazine (e.g., \"Whoa. How the hell would he even walk around with that thing\" and \"Oh why are these [pages] all stuck together\"). One scene allows player to decide whether a young character drinks alcohol. The words \"f**k,\" \"sh*t,\" and \"a*shole\" can be heard in the dialogue."

    "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players assume the role of Dante, a demon slayer fixated on avenging the destruction of his family. Players use melee weapons (swords, scythes) and firearms to attack demon hordes in frenetic melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, explosions, and slow-motion effects; large blood splashes occur often as enemies are dismembered and/or killed. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a giant boss creature chopped to pieces by fan blades; a character getting shot through the stomach; Dante holding up a monster's severed head; a dramatic impaling. Some scenes also depict sexual activity: scantily clad strippers dancing/gyrating provocatively with each other; a woman moving her head toward Dante's lap (fellatio is implied). During one cutscene, moaning sounds can be heard while a female character is bent over a table—a man is positioned behind her, though there is no actual depiction of the sex act. A handful of still images (i.e., concept art) portray women with exposed breasts and/or buttocks. The phrase “crack whore” and words such as “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “c*nt” can be heard in the dialogue."
